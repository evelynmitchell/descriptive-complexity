# The binary increment on a block's atoms

`DescriptiveComplexity.Exponential.OrdFormula` writes the *order* on an
expanded universe as a first-order sentence over the base. Walking that universe
needs one thing more: its **covering relation**, and the two endpoints of the
order. An assignment is read as a binary number – the set of atoms it makes
true, most significant at the smallest atom – so the immediate successor is the
schoolchild's increment: find the greatest atom the assignment misses, put it
in, and take out every atom above it.

This file proves that at the level of **sets** over a finite linearly ordered
index (`DescriptiveComplexity.setSucc_iff`: the increment *is* the covering
relation of `DescriptiveComplexity.setLinearOrder`), gives the two endpoints
their sentences (`DescriptiveComplexity.SOBlock.botAssignF`,
`DescriptiveComplexity.SOBlock.topAssignF`), and writes the increment down as a
sentence over the base plus two copies of the block
(`DescriptiveComplexity.SOBlock.succAssignF`), by the same quantification over
positions that `DescriptiveComplexity.SOBlock.ordLtF` already uses.

## The padding trap, and the honest atoms

A padded atom (`DescriptiveComplexity.SOBlock.AtomIx`) is a relation variable
with a tuple of the block's *maximal* arity, of which
`DescriptiveComplexity.SOBlock.atomSet` reads only the first `B.arity i`
coordinates – so the sets in the image of `atomSet` are exactly the
**padding-invariant** ones, and the binary increment of such a set is in general
not one: it flips a single padded atom, while padding-invariance forces every
padded atom with the same truncation to move together. **The successor of an
assignment is therefore not the increment of its padded atom set.**

The order is unaffected – two assignments differ first at a padded atom exactly
when they differ first at the *real* atom `Σ i, Fin (B.arity i) → A` it
truncates to – and the honest atoms are what this file works with. Over them an
assignment is an arbitrary subset (`DescriptiveComplexity.SOBlock.realSet` is a
bijection), so the set-level increment applies unchanged, and
`DescriptiveComplexity.SOBlock.assignSucc_iff` reads it back as *the immediate
successor in the order the expanded universe carries*. The two indices are
matched by `DescriptiveComplexity.SOBlock.atomSet_lt_iff_realSet`, whose whole
content is that a real atom has a **least** padded representative – the tuple
padded with the least element of `A` – so that comparing representatives is
comparing real atoms.

Accordingly the sentence takes its lexicographic comparisons on the
**truncated** selectors: `DescriptiveComplexity.lexSelLtF` accepts a selector of
any width, so the atoms it compares are the real ones.

/-! ### The honest atom index

An assignment is an arbitrary subset of the **real** atoms `Σ i, Fin (arity i) → A`
– unlike the padded atoms, where only the padding-invariant subsets occur – so
the increment of §the module docstring applies to the real ones unchanged. The
two index types order assignments the same way, which is
`DescriptiveComplexity.SOBlock.atomSet_lt_iff_realSet`: a real atom has a
*least* padded representative, the one padded with the least element of `A`, and
comparing those representatives is comparing the real atoms. -/

/-! ### The endpoints and the successor, at the points of an expansion

What a machine walking an expanded universe asks of its order
(`DescriptiveComplexity.HeadMove`): which point is least, which is greatest, and
which is the immediate successor of which. Tag first and then the assignment, so
each answer splits: the tag part is *static* – finitely many tags, compared at
formula-construction time – and the assignment part is the increment above. The
lexicographic bookkeeping is `DescriptiveComplexity.prodLex_le_iff` and its
siblings, with one caveat: a point's second component is an *assignment*, not an
arbitrary set, so the witnesses put between two points must be assignments too –
the empty one, the full one, and the ones the walk itself carries. -/
