# Extending an expansion with its own order

`DescriptiveComplexity.ExpExpansion.ordExtend` adds the order symbol to the
expanded vocabulary, defined by the sentence of
`DescriptiveComplexity.Exponential.OrdFormula`, and
`DescriptiveComplexity.ExpExpansion.ordExtendLEquiv` says the result is exactly
the original expansion carrying
`DescriptiveComplexity.ExpExpansion.mapLinearOrder`.

This is the analogue, one level up, of
`DescriptiveComplexity.FOInterpretation.ordExtend` and its `ordExtendLEquiv`,
and it plays the same role: an interpretation whose formulas mention the order
of the structure they read can only be composed with an expansion once that
expansion *defines* its order. It is the prerequisite of the outer composition
that is about the order rather than about quantifiers.

The tag comparison is **static**, exactly as in
`DescriptiveComplexity.lexLeF`: two points with different tags are ordered by
their tags alone, so the defining sentence at such a pair is `⊤` or `⊥`, and
only the equal-tag case emits a real comparison.
