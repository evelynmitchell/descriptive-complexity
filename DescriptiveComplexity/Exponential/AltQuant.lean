# A sentence as an alternating prefix, played one variable at a time

The first of the two normal forms that let a *machine* evaluate a fixed
first-order sentence with a finite control. A machine simulating an
`DescriptiveComplexity.SOGameSpec` has to decide the specification's four
sentences, and the only shape its control can have is a finite set of phases
carrying a tuple of elements. This file supplies the shape:

> every sentence is an **alternating quantifier prefix** over a
> quantifier-free matrix, and the prefix is a walk through the indices
> `0, 1, …, n - 1`, choosing the value of one variable at each step.

`DescriptiveComplexity.altQuantFrom` is that walk. Its state is exactly the
state of the machine that plays it: an index `j` – the phase – and a valuation
`Fin n → A` – the tuple – of which only the coordinates below `j` matter.
Each step **updates one coordinate**, existentially or universally as the
polarity `pol j` says, and at `j = n` the matrix is read off.

`DescriptiveComplexity.exists_altQuant` produces the data (the length `n`, the
polarities and the matrix) for an arbitrary sentence, by
`FirstOrder.Language.BoundedFormula.toPrenex` followed by an induction on
`FirstOrder.Language.BoundedFormula.IsPrenex`.

## Why the valuation is total, and updated in place

A prenex prefix is usually peeled with `Fin.snoc`, the valuation growing one
coordinate at a time; the matrix then sits at a level that changes during the
induction and the arithmetic `(k + 1) + m = k + (m + 1)` has to be transported
along a cast at every step. Here the total length `n` is *fixed by the
induction hypothesis* and it is the number `k` of variables already bound that
grows, so the matrix never moves, no cast appears, and – this is the point –
the resulting predicate is literally the transition system a machine runs:
one phase index, one tuple, one coordinate written per step.

Only the coordinates *below* `j` of the valuation matter
(`DescriptiveComplexity.altQuantFrom_congr_val`), so a machine playing
the prefix may carry an arbitrary tuple and overwrite it as it goes. -/
