# Guessing a point of an expanded universe

The translation lemma (`DescriptiveComplexity.ExpExpansion.exists_translate`) –
*an FO sentence over an expansion is a second-order sentence over the base* –
peels one quantifier at a time into one
second-order block. What that block has to hold is a **point** of the expanded
universe: a tag together with an assignment of the expansion's block.

The assignment half is what a block quantifier already ranges over. The tag half
is the problem: everywhere else in this development a tag is *static*, chosen at
formula-construction time (`relSentence` is indexed by a tuple of tags,
`ordSentence` compares two of them by trichotomy). A quantified point chooses its
tag at *evaluation* time, so the tag has to become part of the guessed object.

The encoding: extend the block by **one arity-0 relation variable per tag**
(`DescriptiveComplexity.SOBlock.withTag`). An arity-0 variable is a bit – the
same observation `DescriptiveComplexity.PSpace`'s docstring makes about finite
control in an SO(TC) walk – so a tag is a bit vector, and
`DescriptiveComplexity.SOBlock.tagGuardF` is the sentence saying exactly one bit
is set. Its correctness
(`DescriptiveComplexity.SOBlock.realize_tagGuardF`) says the guard holds of an
assignment exactly when that assignment *is* a tagged assignment, which is the
form the peeling step consumes.

Nothing here depends on the expansion, only on a block and a finite tag type.

/-- A block extended with one **arity-0** relation variable per tag. An arity-0
variable is a bit, so an assignment of this block is an assignment of `B`
together with a bit vector naming a tag.

An `abbrev` deliberately: with a semireducible `def` in between, instance
search cannot see that the arity of a tag variable is `0`, and `Fin 0 → A`
stops being recognized as a subsingleton. -/

proof needs are found through it. -/
