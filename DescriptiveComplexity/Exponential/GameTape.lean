# The tape of a machine playing a second-order game

The layout half of `SO-GAME ≤ʳᶠᵒ[≤] ATMAcceptSpace`: which tagged tuples the
emitted machine calls positions, in what order they sit, and what a tape *is*.

## The layout

```
  ⊢₀ ⊢₁ | region 0: one cell per atom | region 1: one cell per atom | ⊣
```

A **cell** is `(region, relation variable i, ā)` with `ā` a tuple of `arity i`
elements of the instance, so the cells of one region are exactly the atoms of a
block assignment and a region *is* a point of the second-order game – `n^a`
bits, one tape's worth, which is the whole reason `APSPACE = EXPTIME`. The two
regions hold the current position and the candidate; their roles swap at each
move of the game, so nothing is ever copied.

**The two left sentinels** are there because `DescriptiveComplexity.TMData.Step`
has no stay-put option: every step moves the head, so the phases that do not
touch the tape have to bounce it somewhere harmless, and they bounce between
these two. Two of them exist whatever `|A|` is, because a sentinel tag pins
*every* coordinate to the minimum and so carries exactly one position. The right
sentinel does the same service for a step that runs off the last cell.

## A cell holds its own address

The symbol in the cell of the atom `i ā` of region `r` is not a bit but
`DescriptiveComplexity.valPt b r i ā`: the bit **together with the address of
the cell**. That is the one decision of the layout that is repaid several times
over, and it is available only because a tape here is a function
`A → A` into the *emitted universe*, so a symbol may carry a tuple.

> The machine never has to know where its head is.

Without it, every walk would have to carry the head's address in its state and
preserve the invariant *the tracked address is the head's position* – the
single most expensive invariant of a tape-walking reduction. With it:

* a **seek** to the cell of a computed atom walks right and stops when the
  symbol it *reads* carries the target address, which is a first-order
  condition on the transition's own tuple;
* a **sweep** writing a guessed assignment into region `r` needs no phase per
  region: the transitions that guess are the ones whose read symbol has region
  `r`, and those that copy back are the ones whose read symbol has region `!r`,
  so the machine's own alphabet decides which fires;
* the sentinels carry `DescriptiveComplexity.markPt`, a symbol of their own, so
  a walk knows it has reached an end by reading it, and the initial tape is
  first-order definable and *total* – which is what
  `DescriptiveComplexity.TMData.WellFormed` demands of the input.

## The order

A tag's `DescriptiveComplexity.TapeTag.fam` is what the order is designed
around – the five position families above, then the symbols, with the control
above all of them – and inside a family any fixed order will do, so the linear
order on tags is `(fam, an arbitrary tie-break)` read lexicographically
(`DescriptiveComplexity.machTagOrder`). No hand-built numbering of the
constructors is needed, and none of the control's tags has to be numbered at
all. On tuples the order is then `DescriptiveComplexity.tagTupleLe`, the tag
first and the coordinates lexicographically, which
`DescriptiveComplexity.OrderedComposition` already supplies and already proves
linear.

## The domain

The reduction is *relativized*, so a tag may pin the coordinates it does not
use: `DescriptiveComplexity.machDom` says every coordinate from a tag's own
arity on is a minimum (`DescriptiveComplexity.Canon`). That is what makes the
cells of variable `i` correspond to the atoms of `i` one for one, rather than
`n^{dim - arity i}` times over.
