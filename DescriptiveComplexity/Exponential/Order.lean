# The order on an expanded universe

An exponential expansion's sentences see the order of the structure they expand
(`DescriptiveComplexity.ExpExpansion`). To compose an expansion with anything
that reads *its* order – which is what a complete problem for an exponential
class needs – that order must in turn be **definable by a first-order sentence
over the base**. It is, and this file builds it: the analogue, one level up, of
`DescriptiveComplexity.tagTupleOrder` and
`DescriptiveComplexity.FOInterpretation.ordExtend`.

## The order

Points of the expanded universe are tagged block assignments. Order them by
tag first – statically, by an arbitrary linear order on the finite tag type –
and then by reading an assignment as a **binary number**: `ρ` is below `σ` when,
at the least atom where they differ, `σ` holds and `ρ` does not.

“Atom” here means a relation variable of the block together with a tuple of
elements. Arities differ from variable to variable, so the atoms are indexed by
a dependent sum; this file avoids it by **padding** every tuple to the block's
maximal arity (`DescriptiveComplexity.blockArityBound`), which turns the index
type into a plain product `B.ι × (Fin D → A)` – exactly the shape
`DescriptiveComplexity.tagTupleOrder` already orders. Padding loses nothing:
an assignment is determined by the atoms it makes true
(`DescriptiveComplexity.SOBlock.atomSet_injective`), since every tuple of the
relevant arity is the prefix of some padded tuple.

## Layers

1. `DescriptiveComplexity.setLinearOrder` – the binary-number order on the
   subsets of any finite linearly ordered index type, obtained from Mathlib's
   `Pi.Lex` on functions to `Bool`, so that transitivity and totality are
   inherited rather than proved.
2. `DescriptiveComplexity.SOBlock.atomSet` – an assignment read as such a
   subset, and its injectivity.
3. `DescriptiveComplexity.ExpExpansion.mapLinearOrder` – the two put together
   with the tag, and transported to the subtype `X.Map A`.

The defining *formula* and its realization lemma live in
`DescriptiveComplexity.Exponential.OrdFormula`; this file is the semantics it
is proved against.
