# Which invented values are points, and what the expanded relations say of them

An invented value stands for a tagged assignment of the expansion's block: the
assignment is what the guessed meaning relations give it
(`DescriptiveComplexity.SecondOrderNewRead`), and the tag is carried the same
way, by one nullary variable of the block per tag – so a unary symbol on the
extended universe. Neither is a *point* of the expanded universe on its own:
a point carries exactly one tag, and its assignment satisfies that tag's domain
sentence. Both are first-order statements about the value, and this file writes
them.

* `DescriptiveComplexity.isPointF` – “this value is a point”: exactly one tag
  symbol holds of it, and the domain sentence of that tag, read through the
  meanings among the original elements, holds.
* `DescriptiveComplexity.pointRelF` – “this relation of the expanded vocabulary
  holds of these values”: one disjunct per tuple of tags, guarded by the tag
  symbols of the values, whose body is the defining sentence at that tuple, read
  the same way. The tags are guessed here, where everywhere else in the library
  they are chosen when the formula is built, so a static tuple will not do;
  there are finitely many, so the disjunction is finite.

Both are written over an abstract target vocabulary
(`DescriptiveComplexity.PointSyms` names the symbols and nothing else), and both
are formulas with free variables of an arbitrary type, so that the assembly can
plug them under whatever quantifiers it needs.
