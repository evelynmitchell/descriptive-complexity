# The implication graph of a Krom program

A Krom program, instantiated in a structure, *is* a 2-CNF: its propositional
variables are the atoms of the block at tuples of elements
(`DescriptiveComplexity.KromImpl.KromAtom`), and each clause of the program contributes
one propositional clause per valuation of its universally quantified variables
satisfying its guard (`DescriptiveComplexity.KromImpl.clauseRel`).

So the criterion of `DescriptiveComplexity.TwoCnf` applies, and gives the fact this
file exists for:

```
(∃ ρ, prog.Holds ρ) ↔ no goal clause fires ∧ no literal reaches its own negation and back
```

(`DescriptiveComplexity.KromImpl.exists_holds_iff`). The first conjunct is the empty
clause of the 2-CNF, which has no place in the abstract criterion and is
therefore carried separately: a clause of the program with neither literal
slot filled is `guard → ⊥`, and its firing makes the program unsatisfiable
outright.

This is the Lean-level half of the converse translation from the Krom fragment
to FO(TC): what remains after it is to *express* the implication graph as a
`DescriptiveComplexity.TCSpec`, i.e., to build the transition formulas that walk it. The
half proved here is where the mathematics is; the other half is formula
plumbing.

/-! ### The 2-CNF of a program -/

section Program

variable {A : Type} [L.Structure A]

/-- The clauses of the instantiated program, as a 2-CNF in the sense of
`DescriptiveComplexity.TwoCnf`: a clause of the program whose guard holds at some
valuation contributes the disjunction of its two literals, read at that
valuation. A unit clause contributes the disjunction of its literal with
itself, which is what `DescriptiveComplexity.TwoCnf` expects. -/
def clauseRel (prog : KromProgram L B k) (p q : TwoCnf.Lit (KromAtom B A)) : Prop :=
  ∃ c ∈ prog, ∃ v : Fin k → A, c.guard.Realize v ∧
    ((∃ l₁ ∈ c.lit₁, ∃ l₂ ∈ c.lit₂, p = litOf l₁ v ∧ q = litOf l₂ v) ∨
      (∃ l₁ ∈ c.lit₁, c.lit₂ = none ∧ p = litOf l₁ v ∧ q = litOf l₁ v) ∨
      ∃ l₂ ∈ c.lit₂, c.lit₁ = none ∧ p = litOf l₂ v ∧ q = litOf l₂ v)

/-- The ordered pairs of literals a clause contributes to the implication
graph: the clause `ℓ₁ ∨ ℓ₂` gives the edges `¬ℓ₁ → ℓ₂` and `¬ℓ₂ → ℓ₁`, and a
unit clause `ℓ` the edge `¬ℓ → ℓ`. The pair records the two *clause* literals,
the edge running from the negation of the first to the second. -/
def edgePairs (c : KromClause L B k) : List (KromLit B k × KromLit B k) :=
  match c.lit₁, c.lit₂ with
  | some l₁, some l₂ => [(l₁, l₂), (l₂, l₁)]
  | some l₁, none => [(l₁, l₁)]
  | none, some l₂ => [(l₂, l₂)]
  | none, none => []

/-- **The implication graph, clause by clause**: there is an edge from `p` to
`q` exactly when some clause of the program, at some valuation satisfying its
guard, contributes the pair whose first literal is the negation of `p` and
whose second is `q`. The `DescriptiveComplexity.TwoCnf.Step` on the left is symmetric in
the two literals of a clause, which is why the *ordered* pairs of
`DescriptiveComplexity.KromImpl.edgePairs` suffice. -/
