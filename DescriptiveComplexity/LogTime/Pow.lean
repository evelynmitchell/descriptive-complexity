# The doubling chain: `i ↦ 2 ^ i` is first-order in `≤`, `+` and `×`

`DescriptiveComplexity.powArithDef` – the graph of `i ↦ 2 ^ i` as a formula of
`FO(≤, +, ×)`, [Immerman 1999][immerman1999descriptive] Thm 1.17(2) – is the
lemma the AC⁰ reading of the machine model rested on, and this file proves it,
by exhibiting a *certificate* that a first-order formula can check.

## The certificate

The chain is the halving chain of the exponent: `a`, `a / 2`, `a / 4`, …, `0`,
of length `⌈log a⌉ ≤ log log n`. Its place values `2 ^ (a / 2 ^ t)` are
*positions*, so the chain is a **set of positions**, that is, one guessed element
`Y` – carrying the chain *below* its top, the top being the given `p`
(`DescriptiveComplexity.chainBelow`). Consecutive positions `q < q'` of the chain
are tied by

`q' = q * q` (the exponent doubles) or `q' = 2 * (q * q)` (it doubles and gains
one),

which is a product of elements – available – rather than an addition of
exponents, which is not. That is the whole reason the chain is guessed at all.

## Why the exponents have to be carried, and where

The chain conditions alone leave the *value* of the top exponent free: they force
`index q' = 2 * index q + ε` with `ε` read off which case fired, so they pin the
top index only relative to the bottom. What ties it to the given `i` is a second
guessed element `E` carrying, **in the field between `q` and the next chain
position** (`DescriptiveComplexity.FieldAt`), the number `index q`. No pairing
between the chain and the positions is then needed – the value sits at the place
it describes – and the recursion becomes a relation between *values*,
`val q' = 2 * val q + ε`, which is `DescriptiveComplexity.val_eq_of_chain`.

So the certificate is **two elements**, not three: the chain delimits its own
fields, and no marks have to be guessed. That the value fits in the field it is
given is `DescriptiveComplexity.half_add_size_le`, and it is exactly the right
statement – the field between the positions of index `k / 2` and `k` is
`k - k / 2` bits wide, and the value it must hold is `k / 2`.

Four consequences worth keeping:

* **Soundness needs no condition on the layout.** The formula never says where a
  field ends or that fields do not overlap: whatever the guess, each `q` reads
  *some* value, and the chain conditions force those values to be the indices.
  A garbage layout simply fails the conditions.
* **The top field must not be written.** Its value is `a` itself, needing
  `log log n` bits *above* position `a`, and there need be no room: `2 ^ a < n`
  says nothing about `2 ^ (a + log log n)`. The value at the top is the given
  element `i`, so the fields carry only the rest of the chain, whose largest
  entry is `a / 2` and which therefore fits below position `a`. The top position
  is also the one with no next chain position, so it is exactly the one with no
  field to read: the two facts are the same fact.
* **The top position is left out of `Y` for a second reason.** A set of
  positions is an element only if its value is a rank, and the chain *including*
  its top can exceed `2 ^ a`, hence the universe – there is no room for a bit at
  `p` itself when `n` is barely above `2 ^ a`. Leaving it out costs nothing, `p`
  being given, and the rest fits with room to spare:
  `DescriptiveComplexity.chainBelow_lt`.
* **The chain conditions are between consecutive positions only.** That is what
  `DescriptiveComplexity.chainSet_le_half_of_lt` buys – the predecessor of the
  entry `k` is `k / 2` and nothing lies between – so a formula quantifying “`q`
  and `q'` in `Y` with nothing of `Y` between” sees exactly the pairs the
  recursion talks about.

## What is here, in three layers

* **The arithmetic**, in `ℕ`: the chain as a set
  (`DescriptiveComplexity.ChainSet`), the fact that the predecessor of `k` in it
  is `k / 2` (`DescriptiveComplexity.chainSet_le_half_of_lt`), the induction that
  turns the chain conditions into `val k = k`
  (`DescriptiveComplexity.val_eq_of_chain`), and the two elements a certificate
  guesses – `DescriptiveComplexity.chainBelow`, read back by
  `DescriptiveComplexity.testBit_chainBelow`, and
  `DescriptiveComplexity.chainVals`, read back by
  `DescriptiveComplexity.chainVals_field`. Both are ranks because both are below
  `2 ^ a` (`DescriptiveComplexity.chainBelow_lt`,
  `DescriptiveComplexity.chainVals_lt`), the second by the capacity lemma
  `DescriptiveComplexity.half_add_size_le`.
* **The certificate**, as a property of four elements
  (`DescriptiveComplexity.PowCert`, over
  `DescriptiveComplexity.InChain`/`ConsChain`/`ValAt`), with both halves:
  `DescriptiveComplexity.powCert_sound` and
  `DescriptiveComplexity.powCert_complete`, conjoined in
  `DescriptiveComplexity.powCert_iff`.
* **The formula**, built with the `DescriptiveComplexity.ArithDef` API and the
  field reader `DescriptiveComplexity.arithDef_fieldAt`, giving
  `DescriptiveComplexity.powArithDef`.

/-- **The certificate is sound**: if a value is carried at every entry of a set
containing `0`, the value at `0` is `0`, and each entry's value is twice its
half's plus its own parity, then the value at every entry *is* that entry.

This is the whole of the soundness half of `DescriptiveComplexity.PowArithDef`,
with the formula stripped away: `val k` is the field a guessed element carries at
the position of index `k`, the parity is which of `q' = q * q` and
`q' = 2 * (q * q)` fired, and the conclusion says the guess describes the
exponents it claims to. -/

says the value fits, and this says the fields of a certificate are pairwise

/-- **The naming bridge, proved**: the graph of `i ↦ 2 ^ i` is a formula of
`FO(≤, +, ×)`, so the index naming of the bit positions costs the logic nothing
after all. This is [Immerman 1999][immerman1999descriptive] Thm 1.17(2), and it
is the half of Immerman's mutual definability that turns the machine model's
logic `FO(≤, BIT)` into a fragment of `FO(≤, +, ×)`.

The formula guesses two elements – the doubling chain below `p`, and its
exponents packed into the fields the chain delimits – and states three
conditions on them; `DescriptiveComplexity.powCert_iff` is that this is exactly
right. -/
