# Alternating machines with a logarithmic clock, at the level of bits

The machine side of the bottom of the ladder: an **alternating random-access
machine** whose registers hold addresses of the instance, whose clock is the
number of *bit positions* of those addresses – logarithmic in the size of the
universe – and whose deterministic steps are **bit operations**, never a numeric
predicate.

## The three parts of a machine

* **Guesses.** A machine names `regs` registers and a polarity for each
  (`DescriptiveComplexity.LTMachine.pol`): the registers are filled in order,
  existentially or universally, by the two players. A register holds an element
  of the universe, that is, an address of `posCount A` bits, so filling one is a
  block of the classical `Σₖ-TIME(log n)` normal form – a logarithmic number of
  guessed bits – and an alternation is a change of polarity along the list.
* **Queries.** The instance is read only through
  `DescriptiveComplexity.BaseTest.query`: an input relation at a tuple of
  registers. This is the random access of the model, and in a structure-based
  framework it needs no index tape: *reading the input at an address is
  evaluating a relation at a tuple*.
* **Sweeps.** Everything the machine *computes* it computes bit by bit, with
  `DescriptiveComplexity.Sweep`: one pass over the bit positions, from the
  lowest to the highest, run by a finite automaton with `σ` state bits that
  reads, at each position, one bit of each register. A base test is a Boolean
  combination of sweeps, reads and queries, so a machine performs a *constant
  number of passes* over a logarithmic tape: a logarithmic clock, and a constant
  number of head reversals.
* **Reads.** `DescriptiveComplexity.BaseTest.bit`: the bit of one register at
  the position *named by another register*, that is,
  `DescriptiveComplexity.BitIx`. This is the second random access of the model –
  the machine addresses its own bits, not only the instance – and it is the one
  thing a sweep cannot do: finding the position `orank i` requires counting
  positions, which a finite automaton passing a constant number of bits cannot.

## Why the base has to be this weak, and what it can still do

Letting the base evaluate an atom of `≤`, `+` or `×` in one step would make the
model a prenex `FO(≤, +, ×)` sentence in disguise, and the bridge to the logic
vacuous. Sweeps and reads are the honest opposite: they see nothing but bits,
and the arithmetic has to be *built* – `DescriptiveComplexity.leSweep` and
`DescriptiveComplexity.plusSweep` (in `DescriptiveComplexity.LogTime.Arith`)
are the comparison and the ripple-carry addition, exactly as
`DescriptiveComplexity.HeadArith` builds them one resource bound higher. A read
is an addressing operation, not an arithmetic one: it computes nothing, and the
model still has no product.

Both restrictions are real, and their boundary is worth naming: a sweep carries
`σ` bits of state past each position, so a constant number of sweeps carries a
constant number of bits per position, that is, `O(log n)` bits of trace in
total – which is what a first-order formula can guess, one element per bit
vector (`DescriptiveComplexity.LogTime.Simulate`). A machine that could *count*
its positions, or revisit them unboundedly often, would leave that budget, and
with it the reach of the simulation.

Without the reads the model would be strictly weaker than AC⁰, and provably so:
with a base of sweeps alone every atom is a regular relation of the bit tracks,
alternating quantifiers over registers are projections, and the whole model
collapses to what a finite automaton reading `Nat.card A` in binary can decide.
That is the reason a read is a primitive here and not a convenience; see
`DescriptiveComplexity.LogTime`.

The three lemmas a bit-level *definability* API needs, so that a construction
built from the connectives and the quantifiers can be read off as a single
prefix over a quantifier-free kernel. They are about `prefixHolds` alone, and
they are what replaces a normal-form theorem: negation dualizes a prefix, a
prefix absorbs a side condition it does not mention, and two prefixes
concatenate. -/
