# The bit layer of a finite ordered universe

An element of a finite linearly ordered universe *is* a number, its rank; this
file gives access to that number **one bit at a time**, in the two ways a bit
position can be named, and relates them.

## Two namings, and what each is for

A bit position can be named by its **index** `i`, or by its **place value**, the
element `p` whose rank is `2 ^ i`. Both appear here, and neither is a variant of
the other:

* `DescriptiveComplexity.BitIx` is the index naming – `BIT(x, i)`, the primitive
  of the classical vocabulary `FO(≤, BIT)`. It is total, needs no guard, and its
  bookkeeping is the arithmetic of the universe: the next position is `i + 1`,
  and “the bit `k` positions up” is an addition. It is what the logic and the
  machine model of `DescriptiveComplexity.LogTime` are built on, because reading
  a bit at a *guessed* index is the random access those machines have.
* `DescriptiveComplexity.BitAt` is the place-value naming, and it is what makes
  a bit first-order in `FO(≤, +, ×)` (`DescriptiveComplexity.arithDef_bit`): the
  bit of `x` at place value `p` is a division with remainder, `x = u + v` with
  `2p ∣ u` and `p ≤ v < 2p`, all three of whose witnesses are below `x`, hence
  are ranks of the universe and are not lost to truncation. Being a place value
  is itself first-order – `orank p ≠ 0` together with “every divisor is `1` or
  even” (`DescriptiveComplexity.isPos_iff_forall_dvd`).

`DescriptiveComplexity.bitIx_iff_bitAt` is the bridge, and it is one
existential: `BitIx i x` is `BitAt p x` at the `p` of rank `2 ^ i`. What that
existential costs is the *definability of the graph of* `i ↦ 2 ^ i`
(`DescriptiveComplexity.PowArithDef`) – [Immerman 1999][immerman1999descriptive]
Thm 1.17(2), and the single lemma on which the translation of the machine's
logic into `FO(≤, +, ×)` rests. It is a named statement rather than an
assumption, and it is proved: `DescriptiveComplexity.powArithDef`
(`LogTime/Pow.lean`); see `DescriptiveComplexity.LogTime`.

The number of positions is `Nat.clog 2 (Nat.card A)`
(`DescriptiveComplexity.posCount`), and the ranks are exactly the numbers whose
bits live in that range; the top index is
`DescriptiveComplexity.IsTopIx`, read off the bits of the greatest element and
so needing no arithmetic on exponents.

## What a bit vector can hold

A single element holds one bit per position, so it can carry a whole
`Bool`-valued function of the positions – provided the value stays below the
size of the universe. That is the reason for
`DescriptiveComplexity.exists_orank_testBit`, stated with an explicit bit
budget: below `posCount A` a bit vector is *not* in general a rank (the universe
need not have a power of two elements), below `posCount A - 1` it always is.
That one-position gap is what forces the sweep simulation of
`DescriptiveComplexity.LogTime` to carry the state of its last step separately,
and it is the only place the arithmetic of the layer is not uniform.

/-! #### The naming bridge

The one thing the place-value naming does not hand over. Everything above is a
formula of `FO(≤, +, ×)` outright; the *index* naming needs, on top of it, the
graph of `i ↦ 2 ^ i`, and that is a theorem rather than a construction – the
half of [Immerman 1999][immerman1999descriptive] Thm 1.17 that goes from `+, ×`
to `BIT` at an exponent. It is named here, where its consumers are, and proved
in `DescriptiveComplexity.LogTime.Pow`, which is where the certificate it is
proved by can be stated. -/

/-- **The naming bridge**: the graph of `i ↦ 2 ^ i` is a formula of
`FO(≤, +, ×)`, uniformly in the variable layout.

This is [Immerman 1999][immerman1999descriptive] Thm 1.17(2), and it is proved:
`DescriptiveComplexity.powArithDef`, by the packing argument that guesses the
doubling chain of `i`. It is a `def` rather than a plain statement because every
consumer needs it at its own variable layout;
`DescriptiveComplexity.BitDefinable` is a logic over the index naming, and this
is what turns its bit atom back into the place-value one. -/
