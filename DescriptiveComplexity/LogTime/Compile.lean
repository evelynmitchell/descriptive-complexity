# The lower fence: a bit-level prenex logic, compiled into machines

`DescriptiveComplexity.LTDecidable.bitDefinable` puts the machine model inside
the bit-level logic. This file puts that logic back inside the machine model, so
that the fence is an **equality** and the picture is

prenex `FO(≤, +, BIT)`  =  constant-alternation logarithmic time.

`DescriptiveComplexity.ltDecidable_iff_bitDefinable` is that equality: the
machine model of this development is exactly characterized by a logic, with no
normal form left to apply and no gap left to name on either side of it.

## The logic

`DescriptiveComplexity.BitSentence`: a quantifier prefix – a polarity per
variable, exactly the shape a machine's registers have – over a quantifier-free
kernel built from four atoms (`DescriptiveComplexity.BitAtom`): the order, the
addition of ranks, an input relation at a tuple of variables, and the bit
`BitIx i x` of `x` at the index `i`.

That last atom is where the model gets its power, and it is a *read* rather than
a computation: the machine has the index in a register and addresses the bit
there (`DescriptiveComplexity.BaseTest.bit`). No sweep can do it – locating the
position `orank i` means counting positions, and an automaton carrying a constant
number of bits cannot – which is exactly why it is a primitive and not a
construction.

## The addition is a derived predicate

`DescriptiveComplexity.bitDef_plus_free`: the atom
`DescriptiveComplexity.BitAtom.plus` is redundant. `orank x + orank y = orank z`
is bit-definable from the order and the bit atom alone, by carry-lookahead
(`DescriptiveComplexity.plus_iff_bits`), so the logic of this file is
`FO(≤, BIT)` under another name – its classical name, and in the sharpest sense,
since `≤` is itself first-order definable from `BIT` alone, whence
`FO(BIT) = FO(≤, BIT)` ([Dawar, Doets, Lindell & Weinstein
1998][dawar1998finiteranks] Thm. 2.1 and Cor. 2.3: `BIT` is Ackermann
membership, `(A, BIT)` is an ∈-initial segment of the hereditarily finite sets,
and one formula defines the order on all of them – it guesses the order relation
itself as an *element*, a set of pairs, and checks it is a post-fixed point of
the “greatest differing member” operator). That elimination is neither used nor
proved here: every structure in this library carries its order anyway. The atom
stays all the same:
`DescriptiveComplexity.plusSweep_accepts` is half of what shows the machine has
to *build* its arithmetic rather than read it, and deleting the atom would delete
that demonstration for no theorem.

The lookahead is also where the index naming shows: the carry into position `i`
is “some `j < i` generates one, and every `k` strictly between propagates it”,
with `j` and `k` ordinary elements compared by `≤`. Under the place-value naming
each of those quantifiers had to be relativized to the powers of two.

## The compilation

Atom by atom, with the sweeps already built: `≤` is `leSweep`, `+` is
`plusSweep`, the bit atom is the machine's read, and an input relation is a
query. `DescriptiveComplexity.Sweep.relabel` is what lets a sweep written once
for two or three registers be run on any registers of the machine. The Boolean
structure of the kernel becomes the Boolean structure of the base test, and the
quantifier prefix becomes the register list unchanged – there is nothing to
prenexify, because the source syntax is prenex by construction.

## What is closed, and what is not

The equality with the logic is closed on both sides. The identification of that
logic with `FO(≤, +, ×)`, that is, with `DescriptiveComplexity.AC0Definable`, is
[Immerman 1999][immerman1999descriptive] Thm 1.17, one named theorem per
direction:

* `FO(≤, +, BIT) ⊆ FO(≤, +, ×)` is `DescriptiveComplexity.powArithDef`, the
  definability of `i ↦ 2 ^ i`, which is **proved**
  (`DescriptiveComplexity.LogTime.Pow`), so
  `DescriptiveComplexity.BitDefinable.ac0Definable` is unconditional;
* `FO(≤, +, ×) ⊆ FO(≤, +, BIT)` is the Bit Sum Lemma, the counting argument that
  eliminates `×` in favor of the bit atom, and it is **not** built.

Neither is a defect of the machine: they are statements about two vocabularies,
and the machine is exactly the one of them that a machine can be.
