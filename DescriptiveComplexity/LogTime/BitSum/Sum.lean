# The running sum: counting a long word by counting its chunks

Levels 1 and 2 of the Bit Sum Lemma are the *same* construction at two sizes:
cut a
word into chunks, keep in each chunk the number of ones below it, and verify one
step by counting the ones of a single chunk – which is what the level below is
for. So it is written once here, with the chunk counter as a parameter:

> `DescriptiveComplexity.BitSum.SumOk c B x S Cnt`: `B` delimits the chunks of
> length `c`, and the window of `S` in each chunk holds the number of ones of `x`
> below that chunk – pinned by “`0` at the first chunk” and “one step adds the
> count of the chunk just passed”, the count being supplied by `Cnt`.

Level 2 instantiates `Cnt` with `DescriptiveComplexity.BitSum.PopShort` (the
table), level 1 with level 2. Nothing else changes, and neither level ever has to
know how the level below counts.

## What the soundness needs of the level below

Two things only, and both are statements, not constructions: that `Cnt` is
*sound* (its second argument is the number of ones of its first) and that it is
*total* (every word has a count). `DescriptiveComplexity.BitSum.sum_eq` then
gives the running sums their meaning by an induction on the chunk index, exactly
as `DescriptiveComplexity.BitSum.counter_eq` does for the counter – of which this
is the general form, a counter being the running sum of the constant word `1`.

## The arithmetic underneath

One identity carries the whole thing:
`DescriptiveComplexity.BitSum.onesBelow_add` – the ones below `k + c` are those
below `k` plus those of the chunk starting at `k`. The chunk is read with
`DescriptiveComplexity.BitSum.WindowAt`, whose value is `x / 2 ^ k % 2 ^ c`, and
the truncation is harmless because a window's own count ignores what was cut off
(`DescriptiveComplexity.BitSum.onesBelow_mod`).
