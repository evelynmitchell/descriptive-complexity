# The capture theorem for L: the deterministic machine of a specification

`DescriptiveComplexity.HeadCapture` builds a machine for an FO(TC) definition by
*guessing*. A deterministic machine may not guess, and this file builds the one
that does not: it **searches** where the other one guesses, and it **counts** so
that a search leading nowhere is abandoned. With it, **FO(DTC) definability is
recognizability by a deterministic two-way multi-head automaton**
(`DescriptiveComplexity.dtcDefinable_iff_automaton`,
`DescriptiveComplexity.mem_LOGSPACE_iff_automaton`), the deterministic counterpart of
`DescriptiveComplexity.tcDefinable_iff_automaton`.

## Where the deterministic machine differs

Both machines simulate the walk of a specification, holding the current tuple on
one block of heads and a candidate on another, with the mode in the control.
Three things change.

* **The candidate is scanned, not guessed.** The walk being deterministic
  (`DescriptiveComplexity.TCSpec.det_functional`), a node has at most one successor, so
  the machine may look for it: `DescriptiveComplexity.HeadProgram.lexNextP` walks the
  candidate block through every tuple in turn, and the transition formula is
  evaluated at each. The tuple that passes *is* the successor.
* **The source is scanned too**, on a third block, and the machine keeps it
  there: when a walk leads nowhere it comes back and takes the next source.
* **The walk is given a budget.** A deterministic walk that does not reach an
  accepting node cycles, and a machine following it would never come back. So
  the machine counts its steps on a fourth block – with a mode in the control,
  giving exactly as many counter values as the specification has nodes – and
  abandons the source when the counter overflows. That this is enough is
  `DescriptiveComplexity.exists_iterate_lt_card`: a node reachable along a functional
  relation is reachable in fewer steps than the type has elements.

Every block needs to know when a head is at the greatest element, which is not a
quantifier-free fact of one head; so one further head is parked there once and
for all (`DescriptiveComplexity.HeadProgram.dmk`), shared by the three odometers as
their marker.

## The machine, and the half that says it never lies

`DescriptiveComplexity.HeadProgram.DetNode` (the control graph),
`DescriptiveComplexity.HeadProgram.dFam` and `DescriptiveComplexity.HeadProgram.dWire` (its
fragments and its arcs), `DescriptiveComplexity.HeadProgram.dP` (the machine), the
layout of the heads with the fact that the protected heads are exactly the four
blocks and the marker (`DescriptiveComplexity.HeadProgram.dHeadAgree_iff`), the
relations its fragments run (`DescriptiveComplexity.HeadProgram.dRel`) with all of them
proved (`DescriptiveComplexity.HeadProgram.runs_dFam`) and local
(`DescriptiveComplexity.HeadProgram.headLocal2_dRel`), and **soundness**:
`DescriptiveComplexity.HeadProgram.dInv` – at any node of the walk phase the tuple on
the first block is a node of the specification reachable from a source, and at
`commit` the candidate is one deterministic step away – is carried along every
arc (`DescriptiveComplexity.HeadProgram.dInv_of_walk`), and at the accepting arc it
says that the specification accepts
(`DescriptiveComplexity.HeadProgram.accepts_of_dExit`).

## The search for the successor

It is proved in full, and both ways. Over
the tuples of one mode – `DescriptiveComplexity.HeadProgram.scanFound` (if the current
node's successor, unique by `DescriptiveComplexity.TCSpec.det_step_iff`, is in the mode
being tried with a tuple at or above the block's, the scan walks the block up to
it and reaches `commit` holding it) and
`DescriptiveComplexity.HeadProgram.scanNone` (if there is no successor in that mode,
the scan runs the block to its greatest tuple and moves on) – both inductions
downwards along the lexicographic order, in the style of
`DescriptiveComplexity.HeadProgram.decides_scanP`. And over the chain of modes –
`DescriptiveComplexity.HeadProgram.modeFound` and
`DescriptiveComplexity.HeadProgram.modeNone`, inductions on the number of mode indices
left. So from `candMode` the machine provably reaches `commit` holding the
successor when there is one, and `srcNext` when there is none, in both cases
leaving the current tuple, the source and the counter as they were.

One **step of the simulated walk** follows (`DescriptiveComplexity.HeadProgram.walkStep`)
– at a node that is not accepting but has a successor, with a counter block that
can still be stepped, the machine tests the target formula, searches out the
successor, commits it onto the current block and ticks, arriving at `tgtTest`
one node along with the counter's tuple advanced by one in the lexicographic
order.

## The counter, and the two ways a walk ends

The counter is read as a value of one finite linear order
(`DescriptiveComplexity.HeadProgram.dcount`): the index of its mode, lexicographically
above the tuple on its block. This is the whole of the budget argument, because
a **tick is a cover** in that order – `dcount_covBy_tup` where the tuple can be
stepped, `dcount_covBy_mode` where it cannot and the machine resets it and moves
to the next counter mode – and because the order has **exactly as many elements
as the specification has nodes** (`DescriptiveComplexity.HeadProgram.card_dcount`),
which is the number `DescriptiveComplexity.exists_iterate_lt_card` bounds a walk by.
`DescriptiveComplexity.HeadProgram.dTick` packages one tick: at a node that is neither
accepting nor stuck, with a cover above the counter, the machine moves to the
successor and its counter to that cover.

A walk then ends in one of two ways, and both are proved:

* `DescriptiveComplexity.HeadProgram.walkAcc` – **if the walk reaches an accepting node
  within the budget, the machine accepts**: an induction on the number of steps
  left, `Ticks` supplying the cover `dTick` needs at each of them;
* `DescriptiveComplexity.HeadProgram.walkOut` – **whatever the specification does, the
  machine comes back**: it accepts, or it reaches `srcNext` with its source
  block untouched. This is an induction *downwards along the counter's order*
  (`DescriptiveComplexity.order_induction_down`), the measure being the counter itself;
  at the top of the order the tuple is greatest and the mode last, so the tick
  fails and `tickReset` falls through to the next source
  (`DescriptiveComplexity.HeadProgram.dcount_of_isTop`), and where the walk is stuck
  `DescriptiveComplexity.HeadProgram.walkStuck` reaches `srcNext` through the exhausted
  chain of candidate modes.

## The source enumeration, and the theorem

`DescriptiveComplexity.HeadProgram.srcEnum` walks the sources in the same order –
mode index above source tuple – downwards from any position at or below the
source the specification accepts from: at each position the machine either
accepts (`walkAcc`, when the position *is* that source) or comes back to
`srcNext` (`DescriptiveComplexity.HeadProgram.srcTried`, which is `walkOut` with the
`start` arc in front of it), and the odometer of `DescriptiveComplexity.HeadLex` then
advances the position by exactly one cover – stepping the tuple, or resetting it
and taking the next source mode.

`DescriptiveComplexity.HeadProgram.accepts_dP` conjoins the two halves: the machine
accepts exactly what the determinized specification does. Its fragments are
evaluators, odometers and moves, all deterministic, so the program is
(`DescriptiveComplexity.HeadProgram.deterministic_dP`) and
`DescriptiveComplexity.HeadProgram.compile true` – at most one enabled transition per
reading whatever the guards, and agreeing with the program where they are
exclusive – gives a machine that `DescriptiveComplexity.HeadAutomaton.IsDeterministic`
holds of with no side condition. `DescriptiveComplexity.dtcDefinable_of_automaton` closes the
loop.
