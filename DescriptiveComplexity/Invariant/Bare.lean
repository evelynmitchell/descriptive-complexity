# `≡ᵏ` on a bare set, and the order an induction cannot define

The invariant layer, read over the *empty* vocabulary. There `≡ᵏ` collapses as
far as it can: two `k`-tuples are equivalent as soon as they satisfy the same
equalities between coordinates (`DescriptiveComplexity.equivK_bare`), provided
the set has `k` elements to spare – the duplicator answers a repeated pebble by
the matching repetition and a fresh one by a fresh one, and only `k - 1`
pebbles constrain the answer since the moved one is being replaced.

The consequence is the theorem this file exists for
(`DescriptiveComplexity.not_isLinearOrder_inflLimit`): **no order-free
inflationary induction defines a linear order on a bare set**. Every stage of
such an induction is `≡ᵏ`-invariant
(`DescriptiveComplexity.StepDef.inflLimit_invariant`), and a transposition of
the universe carries any pair to the swapped pair without changing the
equality pattern, so a binary variable of the limit is *symmetric* – which no
antisymmetric total relation on two distinct points can be.

This is what turns the order-invariant convention of this library into a
theorem: the linear order that `DescriptiveComplexity.IFPDefinable`,
`DescriptiveComplexity.TCDefinable` and the rest are handed is not a
convenience, it is something no isomorphism-invariant logic can produce for
itself.

What it is *not* is a statement about a complexity class. It concerns a
defined *relation*; a Boolean query is separated by comparing two structures
of different sizes, which nothing in this layer does – `≡ᵏ` relates tuples
inside one structure. The class-level statement (order-free FO(IFP) does not
capture PTIME, at `DescriptiveComplexity.EVEN`) needs the two-structure pebble
game and is a separate development.

/-- **No order-free inflationary induction defines a linear order on a bare
set.** On a set with at least `k` elements – `k` a variable budget of the
induction – every binary variable of the limit is symmetric
(`DescriptiveComplexity.inflLimit_swap_bare`), and a symmetric relation on two
distinct points is not both antisymmetric and total. The two distinct points
are there because a binary variable forces `2 ≤ k ≤ Nat.card A`.

This is the order-invariance of the library's definability notions, as a
theorem: what a first-order induction is handed with the order, it cannot
build. -/
