# Budgets for deterministic walks

A deterministic machine that simulates a *functional* walk – one where every
node has at most one successor – cannot afford to follow it forever: the walk
may cycle, and the machine would then never come back to try anything else. It
must give up after a number of steps it can count, and the two halves of that
argument are here, both independent of any machine.

## The walk is an iterated function

A functional relation is a partial function, and
`DescriptiveComplexity.stepNext` makes it total by leaving a node without successor
where it is. Reachability is then iteration
(`DescriptiveComplexity.reach_iff_iterate`), and the budget is the pigeonhole:
**a reachable node is reachable in fewer steps than the type has elements**
(`DescriptiveComplexity.exists_iterate_lt_card`), because a shortest walk cannot
visit a node twice – splicing out the loop would shorten it.

## The counter can count that far

The counter a machine can afford is an element of a finite linear order walked
along covers, so what it must be shown is that enough covers are available:
`DescriptiveComplexity.Ticks n z` says `n` of them are, and
`DescriptiveComplexity.ticks_of_orank` says that this holds as soon as
`DescriptiveComplexity.orank z + n` is less than the number of elements – at the
bottom, one cover short of the whole order. Matching the two halves is then a
matter of counting the nodes and the counter values with the same number.
