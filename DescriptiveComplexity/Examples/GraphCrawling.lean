# Worked example: web crawling – data acquisition as graph crawling

This file is the library's second *tutorial*, a companion to
`DescriptiveComplexity.Examples.ConjunctiveQueries`: it walks, step by step,
through the addition of a new problem domain, ending in an NP-completeness
theorem and a machine-checked concrete encoding. The domain is Web data
acquisition: **graph crawling**, the optimization problem underlying focused
crawling of structured documents, formalized by
[Gauquier–Manolescu–Senellart 2026][gauquier2026efficient2]. A website is a
rooted directed graph of pages and hyperlinks; a *crawl* is an `r`-rooted
subtree; the decision problem asks for a crawl containing every *target* page
within a cost budget. The paper proves this NP-complete (its Prop. 4) already
for unit page costs, by reduction from Set Cover; that unit-cost variant is
what this file formalizes, following the paper's proof.

The file follows the user-first arc of the conjunctive-query tutorial: start
from the *concrete problem in the user's own formalism* (step 1), construct
the encoding with the machinery of `DescriptiveComplexity.Encoding` – size
bounds discharged at construction (step 3) – prove the encoded problem
equivalent to the concrete one (step 6), and only then establish the
NP-completeness of the encoded variant (steps 7–9), which faithfulness reads
back to the concrete instances. Every step exercises machinery the CQ file
does not, which is why this example is worth reading second:

* the budget is a *cardinality threshold* – a number in the unary
  representation of `DescriptiveComplexity.Numbers.Unary`, honest here because
  crawl costs are bounded by the page count – checked by a guessed injection
  (`DescriptiveComplexity.nonempty_embedding_iff_ncard_le`);
* the semantics contains a *reachability* condition, which is not
  first-order; the membership proof replaces it by a certificate (an order in
  which every crawled page has a crawled in-neighbor strictly below it),
  the directed, single-root sibling of the Steiner-tree certificate;
* the hardness reduction is an *ordered* FO reduction (`≤ᶠᵒ[≤]`): the
  paper's budget `|U| + B + 1` needs a marked set with exactly one extra
  element, and a canonical singleton is definable only from an order – the
  same triage point as for Chromatic Number;
* the concrete instance type is *single-sorted* with a clamped budget, a
  second worked instance of `DescriptiveComplexity.Encoding` after the
  two-sorted CQ one.

Main results:

* `DescriptiveComplexity.GraphCrawling`: the bundled decision problem;
* `DescriptiveComplexity.graphCrawling_sigmaSODefinable`: membership in NP;
* `DescriptiveComplexity.setCover_ordered_fo_reduction_graphCrawling :
  SetCover ≤ᶠᵒ[≤] GraphCrawling`: the paper's reduction;
* **`DescriptiveComplexity.graphCrawling_NP_complete`**;
* `DescriptiveComplexity.crawlEncoding` with
  `DescriptiveComplexity.crawlEncoding_faithful`: the size-honest concrete
  encoding and its semantic faithfulness;
* `DescriptiveComplexity.crawlDecoding` and
  **`DescriptiveComplexity.crawlWF_NP_complete`**: the computable decoding of
  well-formed (single-root) websites, and completeness restricted to them.

### Step 1: the concrete problem, in the user's own formalism

A user does not start from finite structures: they start from the data of
their own development. Here that is a packaged crawling instance – a page
count, a set of links, a root, a set of targets, a budget – with the
textbook semantics as a plain Lean predicate. Nothing in this step mentions
model theory; it is the problem as the paper states it, and it is what the
final completeness theorem will be *about*, through the faithfulness theorem
of step 5.

root page, the target pages, and the budget (clamped to `n + 1` by its type:

      S.card ≤ B.1

end DescriptiveComplexity

/-!
### Step 2: the vocabulary of website graphs

An instance is a single finite structure: the pages, the directed links, a
mark for the root, a mark for the targets, and a marked set whose
cardinality is the budget – the unary representation of numbers, as used
by Set Cover, Steiner Tree and the other threshold problems of the catalog.

  budget. -/

### Step 3: the encoding, size bounds discharged at construction

With the vocabulary fixed, the concrete instances are encoded as finite
structures using `DescriptiveComplexity.Encoding`: a computable encoder
(`crawlRelBool`, standalone so it can be audited in isolation) and the bundle
whose `card_le`/`le_card` fields *force* the encoding to be size-honest – no
padding, no compression – before anything is proved about its meaning.

Two packaging choices are dictated by the machinery:

* **the budget is clamped by the type** (`Fin (n + 2)`): a crawl never has
  more than `n + 1` pages, so any larger budget is equivalent to `n + 1` –
  and an unclamped `ℕ` budget, counted in unary in the size, would break
  `le_card` exactly as `List`-repetition would for CQ atoms. The WLOG is
  baked into the packaging;
* **the budget is counted in unary** in `crawlSize`. This is the unary
  representation of `DescriptiveComplexity.Numbers.Unary`, and it is *honest*
  here because the clamp keeps the budget below the page count – contrast the
  weighted problems of
  `DescriptiveComplexity/Encoding/UnaryBlowup.lean`, where unary weights are
  exactly what the size bounds reject.
-/

/-- The encoder, standalone and auditable (cf. `cqRelBool`): a plain `def`,
so the compiler vouches that it computes, and the `#guard`s below run it. -/
def crawlRelBool (i : CrawlInstance) {n : ℕ} (R : Language.siteGraph.Relations n) :
    (Fin n → Fin (i.n + 1)) → Bool :=
  match n, R with
  | _, .edge => fun x => decide ((x 0, x 1) ∈ i.edges)
  | _, .root => fun x => decide (x 0 = i.root)
  | _, .target => fun x => decide (x 0 ∈ i.targets)
  | _, .marked => fun x => decide ((x 0).1 < i.budget.1)

### Step 4: abstract semantics – rooted reachability, crawls, and their certificates

The paper defines a crawl as an `r`-rooted subtree of the website; the
semantics below phrases “some `r`-rooted subtree with node set `S`” as
“every node of `S` is reachable from `r` by edges inside `S`” – equivalent,
since the parent pointers of a breadth-first traversal assemble any such
reachable set into a tree, and it is precisely those parent pointers that
the first-order certificate recovers (each non-root node has an in-neighbor
strictly closer to the root). Reachability itself is a transitive-closure
condition, not first-order; as for connectivity in the Steiner-tree problem,
the certificate is what makes the membership proof possible, and it reuses
the `DescriptiveComplexity.reachIn` staging for the distance that
`Relation.ReflTransGen` does not carry.

### Step 6: faithfulness – the encoded problem is the concrete one

The bridge between steps 1 and 5: the abstract problem computes the textbook
semantics on every encoded instance (`Encoding.Faithful`). With the size
bounds already discharged by the bundle of step 3, this equivalence is the
*whole* of the encoding obligation – from here on, every theorem about
`GraphCrawling` reads back to the concrete instances. The worked instance
and the `#guard`s then *run* the encoder against a hand computation.

The decoding direction is what well-formedness is for. An abstract
structure may mark several roots (read disjunctively by the semantics), and
no packaged instance – carrying a single root – transcribes such a structure
without *deciding* which root works, a computation a decoder should not
contain. The well-formedness sentence `crawlWFSentence` (“exactly one root”)
removes these, and on well-formed structures a computable decoder
`crawlDecode` exists: find the root, read the links, targets and clamped
budget off the tables. It assembles into
`DescriptiveComplexity.crawlDecoding`, runs (`#guard`s below), and step 9
restricts the completeness theorem to well-formed instances accordingly
(`crawlWF_NP_complete`). See `DescriptiveComplexity/Decoding.lean` for why
the bundled computation – and not an `∃`-only covering statement – is the
meaningful notion.

### Step 7: membership in NP

NP is *defined* as `Σ₁` second-order definability, so membership means
exhibiting a second-order sentence: guess an object-level certificate, check
it with a first-order kernel. The certificate is the one of
`DescriptiveComplexity.crawlOn_iff_certificate`: the crawled set, its root, the
order witnessing reachability, and the injection witnessing the budget – four
relation variables, nine first-order clauses. The construction mirrors the
Steiner-tree kernel (`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.Steiner.Membership`), with
three differences worth spotting: the step clause walks *into* each crawled
page along a directed edge, the guessed root must exist and carry the
vocabulary's root mark, and the budget injection is total on the whole
crawled set, since the paper's cost counts every crawled page.

### Step 8: NP-hardness, by reduction from Set Cover

The hardness half follows the paper's proof: a set-cover instance becomes a
depth-2 website – a root linking to one page per set of the family, each set
page linking to the elements it contains – whose targets are the elements,
and a cover of at most `B` sets is exactly a crawl of at most `|U| + B + 1`
pages (the root, the chosen sets, and all the elements).

The budget `|U| + B + 1` is assembled per tag: the marked set of the produced
instance is the elements (on the element tag, `|U|`), the marked elements of
the source (on the set tag, `B`), and one copy of the *minimum* of the
input's order (on the root tag, `1`). The `+ 1` is why this is an *ordered*
reduction: a marked set with exactly one more element needs a canonical
singleton, which only an order provides. The root mark and the root's
out-edges are guarded by minimality too, so the junk copies of the root tag
are unmarked and edgeless.

Cardinality bookkeeping is by tag slices: a set of interpreted elements that
is a per-tag family of subsets of the input has as cardinality the sum of
the slices (`DescriptiveComplexity.ncard_tagged_eq_sum`), and both the crawl
produced from a cover and the marked set decompose this way, so both
directions of the correctness proof reduce to arithmetic on three slice
sizes.

### Step 9: completeness

Membership and hardness combine into the completeness theorem – the
formalized counterpart of Prop. 4 of
[Gauquier–Manolescu–Senellart 2026][gauquier2026efficient2]. Through the
faithfulness theorem of step 6, it is a statement about the packaged
concrete instances of step 1: `ConcreteCrawlHolds` is decided by a problem
that is NP-complete, over an encoding that provably neither pads nor
compresses.
