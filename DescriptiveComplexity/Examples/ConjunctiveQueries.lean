# Worked example: Boolean conjunctive queries – evaluation and containment

This file is a *tutorial*: it walks, step by step, through the addition of a
new problem domain to the library, with NP-completeness proofs at the end. It
is meant to be read top to bottom, and to serve as a template for formalizing
further problems. The domain is database theory: **Boolean conjunctive
queries** (BCQs) over relational databases with set semantics, and the two
classical decision problems about them, both NP-complete by the results of
Chandra and Merlin ([1977][chandra1977optimal]):

* **evaluation** (combined complexity): given a query `q` and a database `D`,
  does `q` hold in `D`?
* **containment**: given queries `q₁` and `q₂`, is every database satisfying
  `q₁` also a model of `q₂`?

To keep the tutorial focused we fix the schema to a single binary relation
`E` – graph databases. This loses no complexity-theoretic generality (both
problems are already NP-hard for this schema) and everything below extends
mechanically to any fixed relational schema. A BCQ is then an expression
`∃ x₁ … xₖ, E(t₁, t₁') ∧ … ∧ E(tₘ, tₘ')` where each term `tᵢ` is a variable
or a constant.

The recipe, common to every problem in the library:

1. **Vocabulary**: a relational `FirstOrder.Language` whose finite structures
   are the problem instances.
2. **Semantics**: a `Prop`-valued predicate on structures of that vocabulary,
   total on *all* structures (also the meaningless “junk” ones), with the
   convention for junk made explicit.
3. **Invariance**: the predicate is isomorphism-invariant, giving a bundled
   `DecisionProblem`.
4. **Membership**: the problem is in NP, either by exhibiting a `Σ₁`
   second-order definition (`SigmaSODefinable`) or by an FO reduction *to* a
   problem already in NP.
5. **Hardness**: an FO reduction *from* an NP-hard problem of the catalog.
6. **Completeness**: combine 4 and 5.

This tutorial wraps that recipe in the full user-facing arc, which is how
the steps below are numbered: start from the *concrete problem in the user's
own formalism* (step 1), construct the encoding with the machinery of
`DescriptiveComplexity.Encoding` – size bounds discharged at construction
(step 3) – prove the encoded problem equivalent to the concrete one (step
6), and only then establish the NP-completeness of the encoded variant,
which faithfulness reads back to the concrete data. The two encoding
obligations – semantic equivalence and size-faithfulness – are both
machine-checked, and they are arguably the steps a library user should worry
about most.

Evaluation goes through this arc directly (steps 1–9); containment reuses
evaluation on both sides – its membership is an FO reduction *to* evaluation
and its hardness an FO reduction *from* evaluation – with the classical
Chandra–Merlin homomorphism theorem (`DescriptiveComplexity.queryContained_iff_hom`)
as the bridge. The reductions are all order-free and quantifier-free.

Main results:

* `DescriptiveComplexity.CQEval`, `DescriptiveComplexity.CQContainment`: the two bundled
  decision problems;
* `DescriptiveComplexity.queryContained_iff_hom`: the Chandra–Merlin theorem –
  containment holds iff there is a homomorphism from the right query to the
  canonical database of the left one;
* `DescriptiveComplexity.concreteQueryHolds_iff_queryHolds`: *semantic*
  faithfulness of the encoding – on instances built (by
  `DescriptiveComplexity.queryDbStructure`) from a concrete query (a list of atoms)
  and a concrete database (a list of facts), the abstract semantics agrees
  with the textbook one;
* `DescriptiveComplexity.cqEncoding` with `DescriptiveComplexity.cqEncoding_faithful`:
  the bundled encoding – size bounds discharged by construction, semantics
  faithful – and `DescriptiveComplexity.cqDecoding`, the computable decoding
  back, with **`DescriptiveComplexity.cqEvalWF_NP_complete`**, completeness on
  well-formed instances;
* `DescriptiveComplexity.threeCol_fo_reduction_cqEval : ThreeCol ≤ᶠᵒ CQEval`;
* `DescriptiveComplexity.cqContainment_fo_reduction_cqEval : CQContainment ≤ᶠᵒ CQEval`;
* `DescriptiveComplexity.cqEval_fo_reduction_cqContainment : CQEval ≤ᶠᵒ CQContainment`;
* **`DescriptiveComplexity.cqEval_NP_complete`** and
  **`DescriptiveComplexity.cqContainment_NP_complete`**.

### Step 1: the concrete problem, in the user's own formalism

A user of the library does not start from finite structures: they start from
concrete data. Here a Boolean conjunctive query over variables `V` and
constants `C` is a list of atoms – each argument in `V ⊕ C` – and a graph
database is a list of facts over the constants, with the textbook semantics
`ConcreteQueryHolds` (some assignment of the variables to constants sends
every atom to a fact). Nothing in this step mentions model theory; it is the
problem as a database theorist states it, and it is what the final
completeness theorem will be *about*, through the faithfulness theorem of
step 6.

Encoding this data into finite structures carries two obligations – the
encoding must preserve the *meaning* (semantic equivalence, step 6) and the
*size* (no padding, no compression, step 3) – and the machinery of
`DescriptiveComplexity.Encoding` makes both machine-checked. Stating the size
obligation needs the whole family of instances to be a single type, so the
data is also *packaged* as a record `CQInstance` of its dimensions and
contents. Two choices in the packaging are dictated by the machinery
itself, and both are the kind of judgement call the size bounds exist to
catch:

* **Finite sets, not lists.** With `List`-valued atoms an instance could
  repeat one atom arbitrarily often: its declared size grows without bound
  while the encoded universe stays put, and the no-compression bound
  `le_card` of step 3 would be simply false. Under set semantics the honest
  concrete object is a finite *set* of atoms anyway.
* **The size counts `n` and `m`, not just the sets.** The universe is the
  variables and constants: with `2 ^ k` variables and a one-atom query, a
  size that only counted the sets would hide an exponential universe, and
  the no-padding bound `card_le` would be false.

The packaged type also carries `m + 1` constants, so the nonempty-database
junk convention of the equivalence theorem (step 6) holds by construction.

### Step 2: the vocabulary of evaluation instances

An instance of the evaluation problem is a query *and* a database, packaged
in a single finite structure. Elements of the structure play three roles:
query variables (distinguished by a unary predicate), database elements, and
constants – a constant is simply an element that is not marked as a variable
and can appear both in query atoms and in database facts, which is how the
two halves of the instance share constants. Two binary relations record the
query atoms and the database facts.

As everywhere in the library, the language lives in Mathlib's
`FirstOrder.Language` namespace, next to `Language.graph` and
`Language.order` (a project-local `Language` namespace would shadow Mathlib's
under `open Language`).

### Step 3: the encoding, size bounds discharged at construction

With the vocabulary fixed, the packaged instances are encoded as
`Language.queryDb`-structures: universe `Fin n ⊕ Fin (m + 1)`, relations
decided by membership in the packaged sets. The encoder `cqRelBool` is a
standalone, auditable `def`, and the bundle `cqEncoding` cannot be
*constructed* without discharging the two size bounds – the
representation-faithfulness obligation, closed here before anything is
proved about meaning (that is step 6, once the abstract semantics exists).
-/

/-- The encoder itself, standalone rather than inline in the bundle, so that
it can be audited in isolation: it elaborates as a plain `def` – an encoder
deciding an undecidable predicate could not, the compiler would demand
`noncomputable` – and it genuinely runs (the `#guard`s below). Its
`#print axioms` still cites the classical axioms, harmlessly: `Finset`
membership is decided through `Multiset` quotients, whose instances cite them
in *proof* positions only – executability is witnessed by execution, not by
the axiom report. -/
def cqRelBool (i : CQInstance) {n : ℕ} (R : Language.queryDb.Relations n) :
    (Fin n → (Fin i.vars ⊕ Fin (i.consts + 1))) → Bool :=
  match n, R with
  | _, .isVar => fun x => (x 0).isLeft

  | _, .fact => fun x =>
    match x 0, x 1 with
    | Sum.inr a, Sum.inr b => decide ((a, b) ∈ i.facts)
    | _, _ => false

/-- The encoding of packaged instances by `Language.queryDb`-structures:

packaged sets (`cqRelBool`, a `Bool`-valued query/database structure).
The bounds record that nothing blows up and nothing is compressed. -/

### Step 4: semantics

`RelMap`-based shorthands first: they keep every later statement readable
(compare `MGAdj` and `MGMarked` in `Problems/CliqueFamily/Defs.lean`).

section EvalShorthands

variable {A : Type} [Language.queryDb.Structure A]

/-- `x` is a variable of the query. -/
def QVar (x : A) : Prop := RelMap qdbIsVar ![x]

/-- `E(x, y)` is an atom of the query. -/
def QAtom (x y : A) : Prop := RelMap qdbAtom ![x, y]

/-- `E(a, b)` is a fact of the database (raw: no constraint on `a`, `b`). -/
def DbFact (x y : A) : Prop := RelMap qdbFact ![x, y]

/-- A genuine database edge: a fact both of whose endpoints are database
elements (i.e., not query variables). Facts violating this are representation
junk and are ignored by the semantics. -/
def DbEdge (x y : A) : Prop := DbFact x y ∧ ¬QVar x ∧ ¬QVar y

end EvalShorthands

/-!
The semantic core is *satisfaction of a conjunctive query in a database*,
which we set up generically – for an arbitrary “variable” predicate and
“atom” relation on the instance, and an arbitrary external database – because
the very same notion drives evaluation (database inside the instance),
containment (database quantified over), and the homomorphism criterion
(database = canonical instance). Factoring it out is what will later make the
Chandra–Merlin theorem a ten-line proof.

A *database* over a universe `U` is a binary relation `F` on `U`; since
instance elements that are not variables (the constants) must denote fixed
database values, a database additionally comes with an interpretation
`ι : A → U` of the instance elements (only its values on non-variables ever
matter). A *valuation* witnessing satisfaction maps every element to `U`,
agreeing with `ι` on non-variables and sending every atom to an `F`-edge.

Note the standing conventions of this formalization, both harmless for
instances that faithfully encode actual queries:

* valuations are total, so a query variable that occurs in no atom is mapped
  somewhere but unconstrained (in a real BCQ every variable occurs in an
  atom, so this is a junk-only concern);
* `ι` being total forces the database universe to be nonempty as soon as the
  instance is – the usual nonempty-universe convention of finite model
  theory, applied to the quantified databases as well.
-/

section GenericCore

variable {A B : Type}

/-- The conjunctive query with variables `VarP` and atoms `AtomP` (over
instance elements `A`) is satisfied in the database `F` on universe `U`,
where `ι` fixes the denotation of the non-variables: some valuation extends
`ι` and maps every atom to a database edge. -/

A `DecisionProblem` requires isomorphism-invariance. Thanks to the generic
transport lemma this is a matter of transporting the three `RelMap`
predicates along the isomorphism, for which the library provides
`DescriptiveComplexity.relMap_equiv₁` / `relMap_equiv₂` (in `Interpretation.lean`).

### Step 6: faithfulness – the encoded problem is the concrete one

The bridge between steps 1 and 5: the abstract semantics of the encoded
structure agrees, instance by instance, with the textbook semantics of the
data; otherwise the complexity results to come would be about the wrong
predicate. This is a *theorem*, so Lean holds you to it – get the encoding
subtly wrong and the proof simply does not close.

The equivalence is proved in two moves. First, in the generic `V C` setting
of step 1: each pair is encoded on the universe `V ⊕ C` by
`queryDbStructure`, and the round-trip theorem
`concreteQueryHolds_iff_queryHolds` relates the abstract semantics of step 4
to the textbook one on every such structure. (Its `Nonempty C` hypothesis is
the junk convention of step 4 surfacing: a variable occurring in no atom is
unconstrained abstractly but must still be assigned a constant concretely –
for genuine BCQs over a nonempty database domain nothing is lost, and the
packaged type of step 1 discharges the hypothesis by construction.) Then the
packaged encoding is reduced to that generic statement, giving
`cqEncoding_faithful`: obligation (1) of step 1, against the bundle whose
construction already discharged obligation (2).

The encoder is a computation, so it can also be *run*: the `#guard`s below
evaluate the encoded relations of the worked instance and check them against
the hand computation – the cheapest guard against an encoding that is
faithful and size-honest but simply not the one the author meant. That they
compile at all is itself a check: an encoder whose data decided an
undecidable predicate would be rejected by the compiler (see the hygiene

Faithfulness reads membership results into the concrete world; *hardness*
results also need a decoding direction: the abstract problem must not be hard
only on junk structures the encoding never produces. Following
`DescriptiveComplexity/Decoding.lean`, this takes two steps, both cheap here.

*Well-formedness.* The one junk convention that matters for decoding is a
structure with no constant at all (the abstract semantics can satisfy a
query on it that no concrete assignment – needing a constant to map
variables to – satisfies). The sentence `cqWFSentence`, “some element is not
a variable”, cuts these out; read as a `DecisionProblem` (via
`DecisionProblem.ofSentence`) it restricts evaluation to the well-formed
problem, whose completeness is step 9's `cqEvalWF_NP_complete`. Junk *facts*
(touching a variable) need no well-formedness at all: `DbEdge` guards both
endpoints with `¬QVar`, so the decoder below simply drops them, invisibly to
the semantics.

*The decoder.* The computable
`cqDecode : FinPresentation Language.queryDb → Option CQInstance` enumerates
the variables and the constants of a presented structure
(`Finset.orderIsoOfFin` supplies the renumbering) and reads the atoms and
facts through it, returning `none` exactly when there is no constant.
Soundness and totality assemble it into `DescriptiveComplexity.cqDecoding`,
and – like the encoder – it *runs*: see the `#guard`s below. An `∃`-only
decoding statement would be classically near-vacuous (case on the abstract
truth value); the bundled computation is what makes the decoding direction
mean something – see the module docstring of
`DescriptiveComplexity/Decoding.lean`.

### Step 7: membership in NP

NP is *defined* in this library as `Σ₁` second-order definability (Fagin's
theorem), so membership means exhibiting a second-order sentence: guess an
object-level certificate, check it with a first-order kernel. The natural
certificate here is (the graph of) the valuation: a single binary relation
variable `H`, with `H x u` read as “`x` is mapped to `u`”.

Since a raw guessed relation need not be the graph of a function, the kernel
does not try to say so; it checks instead that

1. every *possible image pair* of every atom is a database edge, where `u` is
   a possible image of `x` if `H x u` holds and `x` is a variable, or `u = x`
   and `x` is not (so non-variables are their own images and `H` junk on
   non-variables is ignored); and
2. every variable has at least one `H`-image;

which is equivalent to the existence of a valuation (pick any image for each
variable: by 1 *all* image choices work). This “all images are good, and
images exist” trick avoids expressing functionality in the kernel and is a
reusable pattern for guessing functions by relations.

The construction mirrors `sat_sigmaSODefinable` (`Problems/Sat.lean`): a
`SOBlock` for the quantifier block, an object-level kernel over the sum
vocabulary, one realization lemma, and the definability theorem.

### Step 8: NP-hardness, by reduction from 3-colorability

The hardness half is a first-order reduction *from* a problem the catalog
already knows to be NP-hard. The classical source for evaluation is graph
coloring: a graph `G` is 3-colorable iff there is a graph homomorphism
`G → K₃`, i.e., iff the *canonical query of `G`* (one variable per vertex, one
atom per edge) holds in the database `K₃`.

The interpretation must build both halves of the evaluation instance from the
single input graph, which is exactly what the *tags* of the framework are
for: a tag `qvtx` for the query side (one variable per vertex) and one tag
per color for the database side. There is a wrinkle worth internalizing: the
interpreted universe is `Tag × V`, so the database side consists of `|V|`
copies of each color, not of `K₃` itself. Junk of this kind is unavoidable in
a tagged interpretation, and the standard cure is to make it *harmless*
rather than to eliminate it: connecting all copies of distinct colors yields
a complete tripartite graph, which is hom-equivalent to `K₃`, so the query
holds iff `G` is 3-colorable all the same.

All defining formulas are quantifier-free, so the reduction is a
quantifier-free (and order-free) one, the weakest reduction notion in common
use in descriptive complexity.

### Step 10: containment – vocabulary, semantics, and the Chandra–Merlin theorem

An instance of the containment problem is a *pair* of queries over a shared
universe: unary predicates mark the variables of the left and of the right
query, binary relations record their atoms, and the remaining elements are
shared constants. The problem asks whether the left query is contained in the
right one: every database satisfying the left query satisfies the right one.

Unlike evaluation, the defining property quantifies over *all* databases –
this is where the generic `SatisfiedIn` with an external database pays off.
Note the junk convention it implies: in an atom of one query, an element
marked only as a variable of the *other* query is not a constant, so it acts
as an existential variable of both queries. Well-formed instances (where each
query's atoms only involve its own variables and constants) are unaffected.

The key structural result is the **Chandra–Merlin theorem**: containment
holds iff there is a homomorphism from the right query into the *canonical
database* of the left one – the instance universe itself, with the left
atoms as facts and every element denoting itself. Both directions are short:
the canonical database trivially satisfies the left query, and conversely a
homomorphism composes with any satisfying valuation. This theorem is what
turns the ∀-databases semantics into an ∃-certificate condition, i.e., into
something NP-shaped.

### Step 11: containment is in NP, by reduction to evaluation

By Chandra–Merlin, containment is evaluation of the right query in the
canonical database of the left one – so containment FO-reduces to
evaluation, and membership in NP follows from `cqEval_mem_NP` through
`ComplexityClass.mem_of_foReduction`. No second kernel needed.

The interpretation must produce a *well-formed* evaluation instance from an
arbitrary query-pair structure, and this forces a design decision worth
dwelling on, because it recurs in every reduction between problems whose
semantics have different junk conventions. In the homomorphism criterion the
canonical database consists of *all* elements (frozen variables and
constants alike), while in an evaluation instance the database elements are
exactly the non-variables. A single copy of the universe cannot be split
both ways, so the interpretation uses two tags – a query side and a database
side – and *routes* each atom endpoint to the query side if it is a variable
of either query (recall the junk convention of step 10) and to the database
side otherwise. The database side carries the left atoms as facts, on all
elements. All formulas remain quantifier-free.

### Step 12: containment is NP-hard, by reduction from evaluation

The reverse reduction expresses the other classical half of the
correspondence: *a database is just a conjunctive query with no variables*.
An evaluation instance `(q, D)` becomes the pair “(the canonical query of
`D`) ⊆ `q`”: the left query has no variables and one atom per genuine
database edge, the right query is `q` itself. Every element keeps its role,
so a single tag and dimension 1 suffice, and correctness reduces – through
Chandra–Merlin on the interpreted side – to comparing two homomorphism
conditions over universes identified by `FOInterpretation.mapEquivSelf`.

/-- The first-order interpretation producing, from an evaluation instance,
the containment instance “(the database, viewed as a variable-free query)
is contained in the query”. -/

### Where to go from here

The two problems above, with their four reductions, exercise every part of
the recipe; a few directions the reader can take next, in rough order of
effort:

* *other schemas*: redo the development for a schema with several relations
  of higher arity – the vocabulary grows, the proofs do not change shape
  (atoms of arity `k` need interpreted elements of dimension `k`, i.e.,
  `dim > 1` interpretations as in `Problems/ThreeColorability/ToSat.lean`);
* *quantifier-free status of the containment reductions*: state and prove
  `IsQuantifierFree` for `containmentToEval` and `evalToContainment`, in the
  style of `threeColToCQEval_isQuantifierFree`;
* *a concrete bridge for containment*: encode a concrete *pair* of queries as
  a `Language.queryPair`-structure and prove the analogue of
  `concreteQueryHolds_iff_queryHolds`, tying `QueryContained` to a
  list-of-atoms statement of containment;
* *query equivalence*: two-sided containment; its NP-completeness follows
  from this file's results with a pair of FO reductions;
* *acyclic-query evaluation*: the tractable fragment (Yannakakis); its
  membership statement is a `DescriptiveComplexity.PTIME` one, hence an
  SO-Horn definition (`DescriptiveComplexity.SigmaSOHornDefinable`).
