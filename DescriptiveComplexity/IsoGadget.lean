# The two marked sides of an isomorphism problem, as structures

Every problem of the GI degree says “the two marked sides of the instance are
isomorphic”, and every reduction between two such problems runs one gadget on
the pattern side and the same gadget on the host side. The reductions built so
far (`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.DagIso`) pay for that shape twice: each
characterization lemma is stated once for the pattern side and once, verbatim,
for the host side.

This file is the first half of the cure. It reads a marked binary relation
inside a structure as a `FirstOrder.Language.graph`-structure in its own right
(`DescriptiveComplexity.sideStructure`), and shows that the semantic condition
these problems use – `DescriptiveComplexity.RelIsoOn`, a bijection of the two
marked sets preserving the relation in both directions – is exactly an
isomorphism of those two structures
(`DescriptiveComplexity.relIsoOn_iff_nonempty_sideEquiv`).

The point is what it makes statable: a gadget can then be given on *single*
graphs, where the pattern/host distinction does not exist, and its correctness
asked for in the form “`F G ≅ F H` implies `G ≅ H`” – one statement instead of
two mirrored families. The forward implication is free, an interpretation being
functorial (`DescriptiveComplexity.FOInterpretation.mapLEquiv`).

Nothing here is specific to a vocabulary: the side is given by a unary
predicate and a binary one, so the same lemmas serve
`FirstOrder.Language.twoGraphs` (`patV`/`patE`) and
`FirstOrder.Language.twoDags` (`patV`/`patArc`), whose extra relations the
isomorphism ignores.
