# Arithmetic with heads: addition of ranks

A head holds an element of the universe, that is – through
`DescriptiveComplexity.orank` – a number below `Nat.card A`. This file teaches a
`DescriptiveComplexity.HeadProgram` to *add* two of them, which is the first of
the fragments the inclusion `AC⁰ ⊆ LOGSPACE` needs: the numeric predicates of
`FirstOrder.Language.arith` have to be decided by a machine whose
guards are quantifier-free, and “these two heads are equal” is all such a guard
can say.

## The walk

`DescriptiveComplexity.HeadProgram.plusP i j k a b mk` decides
`orank (x i) + orank (x j) = orank (x k)` with two scratch heads `a`, `b` and a
marker head `mk`. It is a five-node control graph
(`DescriptiveComplexity.HeadProgram.PlusNode`), every node a `leafP` or a
`moveP`:

| node | fragment | `true` → | `false` → |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `init` | `a := copy i`, `b := toMin`, `mk := toMax` | `test` | `test` |
| `test` | `b = j`? | `check` | `over` |
| `check` | `a = k`? | exit `true` | exit `false` |
| `over` | `a = mk`? | exit `false` | `step` |
| `step` | `a := succ a`, `b := succ b` | `test` | `test` |

so `a` runs up from `x i` while `b` counts up from the least element, and the
answer is read off when `b` arrives at `x j`. The invariant is
`DescriptiveComplexity.HeadProgram.PlusBase`: `orank (x i) + orank (z b) =
orank (z a)`, the counter is still below `orank (x j)`, and the marker has not
been passed.

## Why the marker, and why the fragment parks it itself

“This head is at the greatest element” is not a quantifier-free fact of one head,
while “these two heads are equal” is, so the overflow test compares `a` with a
head parked at the maximum – the `dmk` idiom of
`DescriptiveComplexity.HeadCaptureDet`. Overflow must **exit `false`** rather
than die: a disabled `succ` transition is sound but not complete.

The marker is *not* an input the caller has to have parked, as in
`DescriptiveComplexity.HeadProgram.lexNextP`: it is a **third scratch head, sent
to the greatest element by the fragment's own first move** (`HeadMove.toMax`).
That single choice is what makes the specification clean. A caller-supplied
marker can sit anywhere, and the walk then has three regimes – exit `false`
early, answer correctly, or run off the end with no exit at all – so its
specification would have to be stated by the marker's *value*, as `lexRel` is.
Parking it internally collapses all of that: the marker is the maximum, so a sum
that does not fit is detected exactly when it does not fit, and a sum that does
not fit is not the rank of anything either. What the fragment runs is therefore
just `DescriptiveComplexity.HeadProgram.Decides`, with no side condition
(`DescriptiveComplexity.HeadProgram.decides_plusP`).

## Where the levels go

The control walk is assembled at protection level `K` – every head protected –
because a fragment relation that mentions the scratch heads is *not* local at
the caller's level, and `DescriptiveComplexity.HeadProgram.runs_wireP` needs
locality. At level `K` locality is free
(`DescriptiveComplexity.HeadProgram.headLocal2_top`), and the result is weakened
to the caller's level afterwards, which is where the three scratch heads are
forgotten.
