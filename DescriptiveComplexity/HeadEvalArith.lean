# Evaluating an arithmetic formula with heads, and `AC⁰ ⊆ LOGSPACE`

The last step of the machine route to the bottom class: **a deterministic
multi-head automaton decides any fixed sentence of `FO(≤, +, ×)`**, whence
`DescriptiveComplexity.ac0Definable_mem_LOGSPACE`.

## What is new here, against `HeadEval`

`DescriptiveComplexity.HeadProgram.evalP` already evaluates a first-order formula
of the head positions: atoms are quantifier-free *guards*, implication is a
branch, and a quantifier is a sweep of two fresh heads. It cannot be used as it
stands, for the reason the whole file exists: the formula to evaluate lives over
`L.sum Language.arith`, while the machine's guards live over
`L.sum Language.order`. A guard may not read `plus` or `times` – they are not
relations of the instance at all, but functions of the order – so those two atoms
must be *computed*, not read.

So this is `evalP` with one case split four ways
(`DescriptiveComplexity.HeadProgram.arithAtomP`):

* an atom of the input vocabulary, and an atom of `≤`, stay **guards**, their
  terms carried across the two languages by
  `DescriptiveComplexity.relTerm` (both languages being relational, a term is a
  variable, so the map is the identity on variables; the three declarations live
  in `DescriptiveComplexity.ArithmeticDefinable`, low enough for the translation
  into the bit logic to share them);
* a `plus` atom becomes the **program** `DescriptiveComplexity.HeadProgram.plusP`
  on the three heads its arguments live in, and a `times` atom becomes
  `DescriptiveComplexity.HeadProgram.timesP` – the two deciders of
  `DescriptiveComplexity.HeadArith`, which is what
  `DescriptiveComplexity.HeadProgram.wireP` lets a *node* of a control graph be.

Everything else – the sweep, the branch, the head accounting – is reused from
`HeadEval` unchanged, which is why this file is short.

## The head layout

`DescriptiveComplexity.HeadProgram.ArithScratch` pins the seven heads the
arithmetic needs to the seven positions above the quantifier region: the four
working heads of a multiplication first, then the three scratch heads of an
addition. It has to be *above* the quantifier region because the fragments' own
protection level is the evaluator's current level `d`, which grows as the
evaluation enters quantifiers – and the invariant that makes the induction go
through is that `d + qdepth` does not change.

## The result, and what it does not say

`DescriptiveComplexity.ac0Definable_mem_LOGSPACE`: everything AC⁰ definable is in
`DescriptiveComplexity.LOGSPACE`. With
`DescriptiveComplexity.exists_ac0Definable_not_foDefinable` and
`DescriptiveComplexity.parity_mem_LOGSPACE` this pins the bottom of the ladder:

> `FO(≤) ⊊ AC⁰ ⊆ LOGSPACE ⊆ NL ⊆ PTIME`

with the first inclusion strict and the second's strictness *exactly* the
switching lemma (PARITY is in LOGSPACE here, and outside AC⁰ classically), which
this library does not prove. It also supersedes
`DescriptiveComplexity.ac0Definable_mem_PTIME`, which the fixed-point route gave
for a tenth of the work; that route is kept, both because it is the cheap way to
the same corollaries and because the two together say something the machine route
alone does not – that the numeric predicates are *simultaneously* one induction
and one deterministic walk.

automaton – the quantifiers swept, the input atoms and the order read as guards,
and the two numeric atoms *computed* by
