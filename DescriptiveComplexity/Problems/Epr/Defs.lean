# EPR: satisfiability of an `∃*∀*` sentence

The Bernays–Schönfinkel–Ramsey class ([Lewis 1980][lewis1980complexity]): *is
the given `∃*∀*` sentence satisfiable?* A sentence of that shape has no
function symbols and its quantifier prefix is a block of existentials followed
by a block of universals, so it is satisfiable exactly when it has a model with
one element per existential variable – a *small* model, of which the sentence
nevertheless speaks exponentially much, since a clause is checked at every
assignment of its universal variables. That gap is the whole of the problem's
complexity, and it is why the class sits at NEXPTIME rather than at NP.

## The encoding

An instance is a **flat** description, with no parse tree at all:

* `evar x` marks the existential variables; every other variable of the
  sentence is universally quantified, so no mark is needed for those;
* `cl c` marks the clauses of the matrix, which is in conjunctive normal form,
  and `inCl c l` gives the literals of a clause – a clause is the disjunction
  of *all* the literals it names, so nothing is a binary tree;
* `posL l s` and `negL l s` say that the literal `l` is the atom of the
  relation symbol `s`, positive or negated, and `arg l p x` gives its argument
  at the position `p`; `sig s p` gives the argument positions of `s`.

Nothing here is a chain or a tree, so the encoding needs no order of its own –
unlike `DescriptiveComplexity.FINSAT`, whose parse DAG has to be acyclic. That
is what a prenex form with a quantifier-free matrix buys.

## The semantics

There is deliberately no decoding into a `FirstOrder.Language.Sentence`: the
relation symbols of the encoded sentence are *elements of the instance*, so the
decoded vocabulary would depend on the instance. Satisfaction is defined on the
encoding directly, and being quantifier-free the matrix needs no fixed point:
one clause per kind of literal is the whole truth definition.

A *model* is a finite nonempty type `M`, an interpretation
`I : A → (A → M) → Prop` reading a symbol and an assignment of argument
positions – required to be **local**, so that `I s` is a relation of the arity
of `s` rather than of the whole universe – and a witness `e` for the
existential variables. The sentence holds when *every* assignment of the
universal variables satisfies every clause.

Equality is not part of the encoding. The class is NEXPTIME-complete either
way, and a reduction that wants equality can carry its own equality symbol with
the axioms it needs.

/-! ### The problem -/

/-- **The encoded `∃*∀*` sentence is satisfiable**: some finite nonempty
universe carries a local interpretation of the relation symbols and a witness
for the existential variables under which every assignment of the universal
variables satisfies every clause.

Finiteness of the model costs nothing: a satisfiable `∃*∀*` sentence has a
model with one element per existential variable, which is what
`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.Epr.Membership` proves and uses. -/

/-! ### Isomorphism-invariance

Everything the semantics reads is a relation of the instance, so an isomorphism
transports it: the model is carried over unchanged and its interpretation
composed with the isomorphism, exactly as for
`DescriptiveComplexity.FINSAT`. -/
