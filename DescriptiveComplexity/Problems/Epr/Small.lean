# The small-model property of `∃*∀*` sentences

What makes EPR a *bounded* problem: a satisfiable `∃*∀*` sentence has a model
whose universe is the instance itself. The witnesses of the existential
variables are the only elements a model needs – everything else the sentence
says is universally quantified, and a universal statement survives passing to a
subuniverse containing those witnesses.

The proof counts nothing. Map the instance onto the model by `x ↦ ε x` at an
existential variable and by a fixed element elsewhere
(`DescriptiveComplexity.Epr.collapse`); read the interpretation back through
that map, and let every variable stand for itself. What makes the reading
legitimate is **locality** together with well-formedness: the value of a symbol
is decided by the argument positions its signature declares, an atom names
exactly one variable at each of them, and those variables' values are the ones
the collapse carries.

This is the form the membership proof uses: with the universe fixed to the
instance, an interpretation is a relation on the instance and an assignment of
the universal variables is a *function* on it – one point of an exponential
expansion.
