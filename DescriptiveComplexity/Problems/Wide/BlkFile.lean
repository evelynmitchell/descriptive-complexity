# The file a clocked program lays out

A space-bounded program gives every element of its universe a register
(`DescriptiveComplexity.segFile`), and laying that file out costs one sweep of
it. A program on a clock cannot pay that: a rule sees the control and the cell
under the head and nothing else, so the only stretches it can walk are a fixed
number of **tuple roll-overs** long, and the universe is `|Tag|` of those with
`|Tag|` the program's own rule count.

What it can afford is one register per **block and tuple**, which is also all
that a register's contents ever depend on: the block one-hot goes through
`DescriptiveComplexity.Draw.tagBlk` alone and the name slots are the tuple, so
nothing of a tag beyond its block is ever read back
(`DescriptiveComplexity.Draw.Data.ixBack`). This file is that file:
`DescriptiveComplexity.blkFile`, one register per
`DescriptiveComplexity.Wide.BlkIx`, laid out on a stretch of consecutive
addresses in the block-major order `DescriptiveComplexity.Wide.blkLe`.

Everything it needs is already general – the interface
(`DescriptiveComplexity.IxFile`), the walks over it, the construction on a
stretch (`DescriptiveComplexity.ixSegFile`) and the background
(`DescriptiveComplexity.Draw.Data.ixBack`) – so all that is added here is the
instantiation and the two numbers a caller has to check: how many registers
there are, and that the stretch fits.

/-! ### Walking the file: the pointer's advance and its two ends

The sweep that lays the file out carries the register it is at in the machine's
control, and a rule advances it: `dstSt` is a *function* of the control, so the
next register has to be a function of the current one, not merely to exist.
These three are that function and the two ends its walk runs between; nothing
here is computed – a rule's fields are semantic – so the choice off
`DescriptiveComplexity.exists_ixSucc` is the definition, and its
characterization is what a caller discharges the walk with. -/

/-! ### The stretch fits

The one arithmetic fact a caller of `DescriptiveComplexity.blkFile` owes: the
file has fewer registers than the universe has elements – a block and a tuple
*is* an element of the universe, the blockless register taking the alphabet tag
– and the addresses are `2 ^` that, so a stretch based at `1` always fits. -/

/-! ### The address a clocked file's marks stand for

A mark on the file is an address of the tape (`DescriptiveComplexity.ixAddr`),
and the correspondence is what lets a program hold an address it cannot see –
the one under its head – on registers it can. It is only used on the **argument**
registers, and the two conditions of `DescriptiveComplexity.wmIncr_ixAddr` hold
of exactly those: the argument tags are the greatest ones
(`DescriptiveComplexity.Draw.lt_arg`), so nothing the file has no register for
lies above an argument element, and the block order was chosen to make
`DescriptiveComplexity.blkTag` monotone.
