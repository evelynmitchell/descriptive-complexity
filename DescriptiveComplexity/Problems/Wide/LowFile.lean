# A register file on a stretch of consecutive addresses

The register file the input channel marks (`DescriptiveComplexity.wmSegFile`) is
free, but it is a geometric ruler: the cell of the `j`-th element sits at address
`2 ^ m − 2 ^ (m − j − 1)`, so the file lies entirely in the **top half** of the
tape and reaching its upper registers costs almost the whole tape. A machine with
no clock does not care. A machine whose clock counts the addresses can walk that
file once and never again.

This file builds the other one:

> **the registers are `n` consecutive addresses**, the register of the `j`-th
> element being the address of rank `base + j`.

Everything a walk asks for follows at once, since
`DescriptiveComplexity.RegFile` asks only for strict monotonicity: ranks are
monotone, so the cells are (`DescriptiveComplexity.segFile`). What indexes the
registers plays no part in that, so the construction is made at an arbitrary
ordered index (`DescriptiveComplexity.ixSegFile`) and the elementwise file is
its diagonal – which is what a program too tightly clocked to afford one
register per element will build its own file with. What the geometry
buys is the *cost*: consecutive registers are consecutive addresses
(`DescriptiveComplexity.segFile_gap`), so a move of the walk is one step and a
pass over the whole file costs `n`, against the whole tape for the ruler.

**Where the stretch sits is the caller's choice, and it is not a free one.** The
subroutines written for the input channel's file assume it lies *above* the
addresses the program computes with, since that is where the ruler is
(`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.Wide.Marks`): a scan looking for a register
scans upwards, and the bound it is given is a register. A program that builds its
own file and wants those subroutines unchanged puts it above its data as well; one
that wants it out of the way takes `base = 1`, `DescriptiveComplexity.lowFile`,
whose registers are the first `n` nonempty addresses and which therefore lies
below everything (`DescriptiveComplexity.wideRank_lowCell_le`).

There is nothing to arrange for the addresses to exist: the cell of an element
uses no marked symbol, so a program with this file **writes** its own names into
those cells – one per cell, as it walks the bottom of the tape in its first `n`
steps – and the two ends are recognized like any other register. The one fact
that has to be proved is that there is room, and there is, with room to spare:
there are `2 ^ n` addresses for `n` elements
(`DescriptiveComplexity.card_wideAddr`, the clock of the model read as a count).

/-! ### The file, and where it sits

Which stretch of the tape the registers occupy is the **caller's** choice, and it
is not a free one. The file the input channel marks lies *above* every address a
program computes with (`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.Wide.Marks`), and the
subroutines written for it are stated that way – a scan looking for a register
scans upwards, and the bound it is given is a register. A program that builds its
own file and wants those subroutines unchanged must therefore put it **above its
data** as well, which here means high in its working region; one that wants the
file out of the way puts it at the bottom. Both are the same construction at a
different base. -/

A sweep of the stretch costs the difference of the two ranks, and these are what
that difference is: the stretch is exactly as long as the file has registers,
and the last register sits one short of its end. Every budget of the opening
phases is one of these two numbers. -/

at is some register's, which is what lets the sweep's pointer name the cell it is
writing. -/
