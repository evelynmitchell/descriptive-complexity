# Roaming: what a wide machine may do between its phases

`DescriptiveComplexity.WideAcceptSpace` and
`DescriptiveComplexity.DWideAcceptSpace` put no bound on the length of a run:
acceptance is `Relation.ReflTransGen` of the step relation, with no count
anywhere. So their programs may **roam** – sweep up, sweep back down, and start
again, as often as they like. `DescriptiveComplexity.WideAccept` counts its steps
against the number of addresses, so its programs roam on a budget: as many phases
as they like, provided the lengths add up to less than the number of addresses.

That is a different, and much larger, programming model than a single sweep, and
this file is its interface. Every phase is stated **twice** – once with a budget
(`DescriptiveComplexity.TMData.ReachesIn`, which composes by adding) and once
without (`Relation.ReflTransGen`, its erasure) – so that the clocked and the
space-bounded programs share their phases and differ only in whether the sum is
taken:

* a phase sweeping up a stretch of addresses –
  `DescriptiveComplexity.reachesIn_of_wideUp`, erased as
  `DescriptiveComplexity.reaches_of_wideUp`;
* a phase sweeping back down one –
  `DescriptiveComplexity.reachesIn_of_wideDown`, erased as
  `DescriptiveComplexity.reaches_of_wideDown`;
* a phase running a whole subroutine per address –
  `DescriptiveComplexity.reachesIn_of_wideRounds`, erased as
  `DescriptiveComplexity.reaches_of_wideRounds`;
* a run that ends accepting – `DescriptiveComplexity.accepts_of_wideRoam`, erased
  as `DescriptiveComplexity.acceptsSpace_of_wideRoam`.

The third is the one an outer loop is written with, and the one whose two
readings differ most: the budgeted form charges a round `w` steps and the whole
phase the product of `w` with the number of addresses crossed, while the erased
form charges nothing, which is what lets a space-bounded program iterate a fixed
point through exponentially many stages.

On top of them sits the primitive a roaming program actually spends its time
on – the **scan**, `DescriptiveComplexity.reaches_scanRight` and
`DescriptiveComplexity.reaches_scanLeft`: hold the state, rewrite every symbol
by itself, and walk until the cell where the scanning transition is no longer
offered. A scan leaves the tape exactly as it found it, which is why its
statement mentions one tape and not two, and it is how a program that cannot
read the digits of its own address nevertheless finds its way back to a cell it
has marked.

A program does not know *which* cell will stop its scan, only that one will, so
the form it uses is `DescriptiveComplexity.reaches_scanRight_least` (and
`DescriptiveComplexity.reaches_scanLeft_greatest`): the machine arrives at the
first stopping cell and learns, on arrival, that nothing it passed was one. The
extremum is taken there, once, so no phase of a program has to name the address
a mark sits at.

/-! ### The rank of an address

Every phase below is stated twice: once with a budget
(`DescriptiveComplexity.TMData.ReachesIn`), which is what a clocked program needs,
and once without (`Relation.ReflTransGen`), which is the erasure a space-bounded
one uses. The budgets are all differences of *ranks*: the number of addresses
strictly below a given one, which is exactly the number of steps a machine
stepping once per increment spends reaching it from the empty address. -/

/-! ### The size of a region

A clocked program keeps its data in the least significant blocks, so every
address it visits is empty above a fixed set of positions. Such a *region* is
much smaller than the tape, and the budget of every phase run inside it has to
be charged against the region and not against the number of addresses – a bound
by `card_wideAddr` is a bound by the clock itself, which proves nothing. The two
lemmas here are what charges it: the addresses supported on a set of positions
are that set's subsets, so an address supported there has rank below `2 ^` its
size. -/

beyond. -/

/-! ### A phase that does work at every address

`DescriptiveComplexity.reaches_of_wideUp` asks for **one** step per address,
which is all a scan needs and all a machine on a clock can afford. A roaming
program's outer loops are not like that: at each address it runs a whole
subroutine – walk to the register file, increment the mirror, walk back – and
only then moves on. So the round, not the step, is the unit. -/

/-- **A phase that runs a subroutine at every address.** Give the intended
configuration at each address of a stretch and, between each address and its
increment, a *run* of at most `w` steps rather than a single step; the machine
then gets from the bottom of the stretch to the top, and pays `w` for each
address it crossed.

This is the shape of every outer loop of a wide program – seeking an address,
sweeping a stage of a fixed-point iteration, comparing two tracks of the tape –
and the product is what a clock reads: a program is affordable when the rounds it
runs, times the width of one, stays below the number of addresses. A space-bounded
program ignores the product (`DescriptiveComplexity.reaches_of_wideRounds`), which
is what lets it iterate a fixed point. -/

/-! ### The accumulator of a sweep

A sweep that is asking a question of every address – *do these two tracks agree
everywhere?* – carries one bit across exponentially many rounds, and since it
sweeps *upwards* that bit is a function of the **prefix**: of the addresses
strictly below the one it has reached. This is the address-scale twin of
`DescriptiveComplexity.accState`, which does the same for a walk of the register
file, and it is what the comparison sweep of a fixed-point program is written
with. -/

moves right; the machine then walks from `s` to `t`, leaving state and tape as it
found them.

This is how a program navigates: it cannot read the digits of the address it is
on, so it writes a marker in the cell it means to come back to and scans until
the scanning transition is withheld – at the marker, which is the only symbol the
hypothesis is not asked about. -/

/-! ### Scanning to the first cell that stops the scan

The form a program uses in practice: it does not know *which* cell will stop its
scan, only that some cell will, and it needs the arrival to come with the promise
that nothing before it stopped. -/

/-- **A rightward scan arrives at the first cell that stops it.** Given that some
cell at or above `s` stops the scan, and that every cell at or above `s` which
does not stop it offers the scanning transition, the machine reaches the *least*
stopping cell – and learns, on arrival, that no cell it passed was one.

The caller never constructs that cell: this is where the extremum is taken, once,
so a program's phases are stated about the marks they look for and not about the
addresses those marks sit at. The budget is stated at the cell reached, and a
caller that knows a ceiling for its marks charges the scan against that ceiling
by `DescriptiveComplexity.wideRank_mono` and
`DescriptiveComplexity.TMData.ReachesIn.mono`. -/

reach. -/
