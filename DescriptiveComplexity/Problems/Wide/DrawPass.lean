# A program's rules run its register passes

`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.Wide.Mirror` and
`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.Wide.Test` are the three shapes a register pass
comes in – write with an accumulator, write without one, read with one – stated
about an abstract tape and an abstract supply of transitions. This file joins
them to a `DescriptiveComplexity.Draw.Prog`: the tape is
`DescriptiveComplexity.Draw.Prog.trackTapeAt`, the transitions come from the
program's rules, and what is left for the program to supply is a **rule per case**
and nothing else.

## What a program owes

`DescriptiveComplexity.Draw.Prog.HasLeft` is the contract: *in this phase, at this
pointer, reading these tracks, the program has a rule that goes to that phase and
that pointer, writes those tracks, and moves left.* Every hypothesis below is a
family of those, and the symbols are computed for the caller – it never sees
`DescriptiveComplexity.regBit`, never writes a tape equation, and never mentions
`FirstOrder.Language.wide`. (A whole-track overwrite, and a file test with the
question asked of the *cell*, are in `DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.Wide.DrawSub`:
a wrapper that quantified its per-cell data independently of the symbol could
be served by no deterministic table.)

## The register mark

Each pass needs to tell a register cell from a cell of the working area, because
its rules act at the first and merely walk over the second. One track slot `rg`
carries that (`hrest` below: the slot is set exactly at the cells of the file),
and the guards read it. That is also what separates the acting rules from the
walking one, so it is what `DescriptiveComplexity.Draw.Prog.sep_of` is discharged
from in these phases.

## Which file

Nothing here is about *where* the registers are. The passes that need only the
cells take the family (`DescriptiveComplexity.Draw.Prog.passTracksAt`, and the
lemmas whose `cell` is inferred from the statement); the passes that need a file
to be a file – the two walks up and down to a marked register, and the mirror
increment – take a `DescriptiveComplexity.RegFile` and are named `file…`. The
`wmSeg` statements below them are those at
`DescriptiveComplexity.wmSegFile`, which is the file a space-bounded program gets
free from the input channel; a clocked program builds its own low on the tape and
calls the same lemmas at it.

## One restriction, and where it bites

`DescriptiveComplexity.reaches_mirrorIncr` may stop in a state that depends on the
**carry position**, and the version here does not use that freedom: it stops in a
single state, because a state's payload holds elements of the *source* structure
while the carry position is an element of the emitted universe, and the registers
are anonymous. The carry position is still delivered, as `u₀` with its
characterization, so every use that only has to *move* an address – advancing the
working cell, seeking – is served. The inner loop of the step-formula evaluator,
which folds accumulators against the **block** that rolled over, needs an indexed
variant: the mark of a register cell records which block that register lies in
(finitely many kinds, so finitely many rules), and the stopping rule reads it off
the symbol. That variant is not built here.

/-! ### One step in the working area

A register pass leaves the program's other bits alone; the work between passes is
the other way round – the track is untouched and the **background** changes, at
the one cell the head is on. That is one step, and it is the only place a
program's own data is written. -/

/-! ### Getting to a marked register

The two ends of the file have to be recognized on sight – the last one to begin a
downward pass, the first one to come back from one – and that is all that has to
be. One slot marks the target cell, one rule family walks over everything else,
and the same theorem serves both ends by taking the target as a parameter. -/

`u`, the machine scans right to it, stopped by the slot `sl` that marks that cell
and no other. The cost is the stretch of addresses it crosses. -/

/-! ### Seeking a marked cell

The other navigation a program does, and the one it does in the working area: walk
until the cell whose slot `sl` is set. Unlike the register ends, the program does
not know *which* cell that will be – it wrote the mark itself, exponentially many
rounds ago – so the arrival comes with the promise that nothing passed was marked,
which is where the extremum is taken. -/

/-! ### The mirror increment

The stopped phase may depend on the register the increment carried at – on the
**block** that rolled over, which is what the fold of
`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.Wide.Fold` has to know. The machine cannot name
that register: a state's payload holds elements of the source structure, and the
registers are anonymous. What it can do is read the block off the *mark*, since a
reduction chooses what each register cell starts holding and there are finitely
many blocks; so the stopping rule comes in one copy per block, and the phase it
goes to is the copy's. -/

/-- **A program increments its mirror, and lands in the phase of the block that
carried.** From the last register in the carrying phase with the track at `m`, the
machine walks down the file and arrives just below the first register with the
track at the increment of `m`, in the phase `pd b` for the block `b` of the carry
position.

The four families of rules are the whole of what the program supplies, and each is
a statement about the tracks a symbol carries, not about the tape. -/
