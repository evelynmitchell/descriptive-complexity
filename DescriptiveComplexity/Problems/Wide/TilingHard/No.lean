# A tiling of the emitted square is an accepting run

The backward half of the hardness. A tiling is read row by row: the row of rank
`k` is the configuration at time `k`, and the whole argument is that **each row
holds at most one head, and the row above it is the step that head takes**.

## Why a row holds at most one head

A head in a row is either a head that halted below it, or one a neighbor sent:
the vertical rule lets nothing else stand above a symbol. A neighbor that sends
one is a head *moving that way*, by the horizontal rule, so the head of a row is
determined by the head of the row below it and the transition that head fires –
which is why a tile carries the transition and an arrival is a tile of its own.

The two **edge columns** are where this argument would otherwise fail, and why
`DescriptiveComplexity.TileData.EdgeL` and `EdgeR` are part of a tiling: an
arrival at the leftmost column is sent by nothing, so without a border condition
a head would appear there out of nowhere, carrying whatever state it liked.

## What is read off a row

The drawing is packaged as `DescriptiveComplexity.TilingHard.TileRun` – rows
numbered by the clock, columns the machine's addresses – so the coordinates of
the emitted square are translated once and the argument itself is a plain
induction on the row number.
