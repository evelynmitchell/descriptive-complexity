# Testing the register file

The read-only half of what a wide machine does with its registers. A program has
to ask questions about a whole register before it can act on it – *is the mirror
equal to the target?*, *is it zero?*, *has the working cell reached the end of the
tape?* – and each of them is one pass:

> walk the file downwards in the passing state; at the first register that fails
> the test, drop into the failing state and stay there.

`DescriptiveComplexity.IxFile.reachesIn_fileTest` is that pass, at an arbitrary
property `P` of the registers. It writes nothing – the tape it ends with is the
tape it started with – so a program may run as many tests as it likes between two
computations and disturb neither.

The verdict comes back in the **state**, as
`DescriptiveComplexity.accStateAfter WMLe P qy qn bot`, which
`DescriptiveComplexity.accStateAfter_bot_pos` and
`DescriptiveComplexity.accStateAfter_bot_neg` read as the two cases: the passing
state exactly when every register passes. A caller instantiates `P` with whatever
it is asking – two tracks agree, a track is clear, a track is set – and the
transitions it supplies say how to see that in one symbol.

A pass costs one move per register plus the step off the file, so a caller that
is counting bounds the moves – the addresses between consecutive registers – and
gets the product.

/-- **What a test does at one register**: in the passing state it stays there if
the register passes and drops to the failing state if not; in the failing state
it stays. The symbol is rewritten by itself in every case, which is why a test
leaves the tape alone.

This is the whole case analysis of a test, and – as in
`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.Wide.Mirror` – it happens once. The symbols are
given as a function `g` of the element whose register the head is on, so no
register file is named here. -/

/-- **A test of the register file.** From the last register in the passing state,
the machine walks down the file and arrives just below the first register in the
state the verdict names: passing exactly when every register passed
(`DescriptiveComplexity.accStateAfter_bot_pos`,
`DescriptiveComplexity.accStateAfter_bot_neg`). The tape is untouched throughout.

Instantiate `P` with the question: *these two tracks agree at this register*,
*this track is clear here*, *this track is set here*. The transitions the caller
supplies are then a single symbol comparison each. The cost is one move per
register, each bounded by `w`, plus the step off the file. -/
