# Walking the register file

The phase a wide machine spends its life in. Its register file is one
recognizable cell per element of the instance (`DescriptiveComplexity.RegFile`),
and every register operation – read a bit, flip one, increment a mirror, compare
two – is the same walk:

> stand on the cell of `u`, write there, and scan right to the cell of the next
> element; repeat until the file is exhausted.

`DescriptiveComplexity.RegFile.reachesIn_regStep` is one such move and
`DescriptiveComplexity.RegFile.reachesIn_regWalk` is the whole traversal, the
latter being the only induction a program has to be given: the machine's state
and its tape are handed over *as functions of the element the pointer has
reached*, and what is discharged is a single move between an element and its
successor.

Both come in the other direction too
(`DescriptiveComplexity.RegFile.reachesIn_regStepBack`,
`DescriptiveComplexity.RegFile.reachesIn_regWalkBack`), and that reading is not a
convenience: the least significant digit of an address is the `WMLe`-**greatest**
element, so a program **incrementing its mirror** – clear the trailing digits, set
the first that is clear – walks the file from its last register towards its
first.

Getting *to* a register in the first place – the last one, to begin a downward
pass, and the first one, to come back from it – is
`DescriptiveComplexity.RegFile.reachesIn_toReg` and
`DescriptiveComplexity.RegFile.reachesIn_toRegBack`: one scan each, stopped by a
symbol the target register carries and the others do not. Only the two ends of
the file need such a symbol; in a file the input channel marks, those in between
are all the same one, and must be, since a symbol is an element and there are as
many registers as elements.

Two facts make a move between consecutive registers a single scan rather than a
search: consecutive elements have **no register between them**
(`DescriptiveComplexity.RegFile.gap`), so the scan cannot overshoot or stop
early; and the pointer lives in the machine's **control**, where a state may hold
an element of the instance, so no address arithmetic is involved in knowing which
register one is on.

## What a walk costs

Each statement comes in a budgeted form and an erased one. A move between
consecutive registers costs exactly the addresses lying between them, and a walk
of a stretch of the file costs the registers it crosses times whatever bound the
caller puts on one move. Which form a program uses is the whole difference
between the space-bounded wide problems and the clocked one: the file the input
channel marks is a geometric ruler in the top half of the tape, so walking it is
affordable only when nothing is counting.

Every statement is also given at `DescriptiveComplexity.wmSeg`, so that a program
written against the file of the input channel names no
`DescriptiveComplexity.RegFile` at all.

**What indexes the registers is a parameter.** Every proof here is about the
order the cells are laid out in and about nothing else, so each statement is
made at a `DescriptiveComplexity.IxFile` – a file over an arbitrary ordered
index – and the elementwise form is its diagonal
(`DescriptiveComplexity.RegFile.toIx`), one line each. The pointer is a function
of the index and the *states* stay elements of the instance, which is what makes
the generalization free: a walk never holds an index anywhere the machine can
see, only its caller does. Two linear orders separate in the general form – the
addresses' and the index's – and a statement that needs only one says so.

the address, and of nothing else about the track.

Stated at the *cells* rather than at a `DescriptiveComplexity.RegFile`, because a
program's tape is a **definition** and a file carries proofs: threading the whole
record through the definitions would make them depend on the linearity of the
order, which nothing about them does. The file appears in the theorems below,
where the proofs are wanted. -/

A caller finishes with `congrArg`: its tape is some `g r (bitAtOf cell m r)`, and
this says the second argument does not move. -/

/-! ### One move of the walk -/

omit [Finite I] in
/-- **One move of a register walk.** In the state `q`, on the cell of `u`, the
machine writes there and moves right; then, in the state `q'`, it scans over the
cells that are nobody's register; it arrives on the cell of the successor of `u`,
having spent exactly the addresses lying between the two registers.

The write is described the way every write in this development is – by naming the
new symbol assignment `f'` and saying it agrees with `f` off the cell of `u` – and
the scan is asked for only at the cells that are nobody's register, which is
exactly where `DescriptiveComplexity.RegFile.gap` says the machine will pass. -/

to a *particular* register – the last one to begin a downward pass, the first one
to come back from it, or the one a pointer in the control names. Each is a scan
whose stopping symbol is the name the register carries, and the two facts that
make it one scan are that the registers are ordered like their elements and that
a register's symbol names it. -/

all hold the one generic mark, so that is a single transition – and withholds it
at the symbol the register of `u` carries, which is what stops the scan. -/

The passes of `DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.Wide.Mirror` and
`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.Wide.Test` take the tape as a function of *one
track*, `tapeOf m`, and each asks for the same coherence condition: changing the
track at one element changes the tape at that element's cell and nowhere else. A
program does not verify that by hand. It builds its tape by reading the track
through `DescriptiveComplexity.RegFile.bitAt` – the track's digit at a register
cell, nothing anywhere else – and
`DescriptiveComplexity.RegFile.bitAt_congr` is the condition, discharged once for
every program and every alphabet. -/

the scan is asked for only at the cells that are nobody's register, which is

/-! ### Reaching a named register

Before a pass can start, and between one pass and the next, the head has to get
to a *particular* register – the last one to begin a downward pass, the first one
to come back from it, or the one a pointer in the control names. Each is a scan
whose stopping symbol is the name the register carries, and the two facts that
make it one scan are that the registers are ordered like their elements and that
a register's symbol names it. -/

/-- **Walking up to a distinguished register.** From any cell at or below the
register of `u`, in a fixed state, the machine scans right to it. The caller
offers the scanning transition at the cells that are nobody's register and at the
registers of the *other* elements – which in a file marked by the input channel
all hold the one generic mark, so that is a single transition – and withholds it
at the symbol the register of `u` carries, which is what stops the scan. -/

/-! ### A track over the register file

The passes of `DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.Wide.Mirror` and
`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.Wide.Test` take the tape as a function of *one
track*, `tapeOf m`, and each asks for the same coherence condition: changing the
track at one element changes the tape at that element's cell and nowhere else. A
program does not verify that by hand. It builds its tape by reading the track
through `DescriptiveComplexity.RegFile.bitAt` – the track's digit at a register
cell, nothing anywhere else – and
`DescriptiveComplexity.RegFile.bitAt_congr` is the condition, discharged once for
every program and every alphabet. -/

/-! ### The accumulator of a downward pass

A pass down the register file carries one bit of information in its control:
whether everything it has seen so far behaved. Since it walks downwards, “so far”
is “at every register above the one it is on”, and the two states of the pass are
therefore a *function of the suffix*. Both subroutines built on the walk – the
mirror increment (`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.Wide.Mirror`) and the file
tests (`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.Wide.Test`) – are that shape, so it is
settled here. -/
