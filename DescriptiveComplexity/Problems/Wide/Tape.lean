# A program's tape is a function of the address

`DescriptiveComplexity.TMData` takes the tape to be a function on the whole
universe of the machine, `WPoint A → WPoint A`. A *program*'s tape is never that
general: the control points are not cells, so they keep the blank they started
with for ever, and every real cell holds a symbol – an element of the instance.
So a program's tape is a function

> `f : (A → Prop) → A`, a symbol for each address,

and `DescriptiveComplexity.wideTape` is the machine's tape it presents. Working
in that form is worth a file of its own because it removes the same three
obligations from every step of every phase:

| obligation | in the general form | here |
|---|---|---|
| the symbol under the head | `tp (Sum.inl s) = Sum.inr a` | `f s`, no equation |
| the frame condition | `∀ p : WPoint A, p ≠ Sum.inl s → …` | `∀ r, r ≠ s → f' r = f r` |
| the control points | a case of every proof | discharged once |

`DescriptiveComplexity.step_wideTape_right` and its leftward twin are the step
in that form, `DescriptiveComplexity.reaches_scan_tape` and
`DescriptiveComplexity.reaches_scanBack_tape` are the scans, and
`DescriptiveComplexity.isInit_wideTape` is the initial configuration of a program
that has marked its register file
(`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.Wide.Marks`).

Note what is *not* here: `Function.update`. An address is a set, so equality of
addresses is not decidable, and a program's tapes come from formulas anyway. A
write is described by naming the new tape function and saying where it agrees
with the old one, which is what `hagree` is in every statement below.

/-! ### Writing a track across the tape

The phase a program spends laying something out: sweep up, writing one symbol per
address as it goes. The tape it holds part-way through is written below the head
and untouched at and above it, which is the address-scale twin of
`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.Wide.Mirror`'s mirror during a register walk.

The new symbols are a *parameter*, so the same statement serves a deterministic
layout phase – build the register file, plant a marker – and a **guessing** one:
if the transition offered at each cell may write either of two symbols, the run
below exists for every choice, and the choice is the certificate. -/

passed, the old one where it stands and above. The value type is arbitrary – a
sweep installs symbols this way, and a program installs whole backgrounds. -/

/-- **A writing sweep carrying a state.** At every cell of a stretch the machine
writes the new symbol and moves right, and its state advances with the head: at
the cell `r` it is `st r`, and the step to `r`'s successor leaves it in that
successor's state. It arrives at the top of the stretch with the tape rewritten
below it and untouched above.

A state that varies is what lets a sweep write something *different* in every
cell: a rule computes its symbol from what it reads and from the state, and the
tape it reads is blank everywhere, so a phase laying down a pattern has to hold
the pattern's index in the state. That is how a program builds its own register
file – the state holds the element whose register the head is on, and the order
successor moves it along. -/
