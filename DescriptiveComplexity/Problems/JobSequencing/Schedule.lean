# What a schedule can achieve

The one semantic fact about job sequencing that a reduction into it needs:
when every job carries the **same deadline** and its penalty equals its
execution time, a schedule is nothing but a choice of the jobs that meet the
deadline. Two halves:

* `DescriptiveComplexity.finsum_onTime_le` – the jobs a schedule leaves on time weigh
  at most the deadline. They are exactly the jobs at or before the *last* of
  them, so their total execution time is that job's completion time, and that
  job is on time;
* `DescriptiveComplexity.exists_schedule_onTime` – conversely, any set of jobs
  weighing at most the deadline can be put first, by ordering the universe
  through the key “not chosen, then the ambient order”
  (`DescriptiveComplexity.isLinOrd_of_key`), and then all of it is on time.

Together they give `DescriptiveComplexity.hasGoodSchedule_iff_exists_subset` and, when
the jobs weigh twice the deadline and the bound is the deadline,
`DescriptiveComplexity.hasGoodSchedule_iff_exists_half`: the instance is a
yes-instance exactly when some set of jobs weighs *exactly* the deadline.
That last form is Partition's condition, which is why a reduction into job
sequencing can be built out of a balanced-split gadget – provided it also
writes the deadline, its double and the bound, which is what constrains the
gadget.
