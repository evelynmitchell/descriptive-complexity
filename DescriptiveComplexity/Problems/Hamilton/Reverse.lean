# Vertex Cover from a Hamilton circuit

The reverse direction of the reduction reads a vertex cover off a Hamilton
circuit of the gadget graph. Its foundation is a precise characterization of the
neighbors of each gadget vertex (`DescriptiveComplexity.dgEdge_iff` /
`DescriptiveComplexity.IAdjRaw`).

## Structure

1. **Neighbor sets.** For each gadget vertex, the exact set of its
   `DescriptiveComplexity.DGEdge`-neighbors (by cases on the other vertex's tag, via
   `dgEdge_iff`). The **internal** vertices `⟨g1,(a,b)⟩` and `⟨g4,(a,b)⟩` have
   exactly two neighbors, `⟨g0/g2⟩` and `⟨g3/g5⟩` respectively.
2. **Forced edges.** In a Hamilton circuit each vertex has exactly two
   tour-neighbors, both adjacent to it. So a degree-two vertex uses *both* its
   edges, forcing the paths `g0-g1-g2` and `g3-g4-g5` in every gadget
   (`DescriptiveComplexity.forced_g1`, `DescriptiveComplexity.forced_g4`).
3. **The three traversals.** Propagating through `g2`, `g3` (degree three) shows
   each gadget is traversed through the `u`-side, the `v`-side, or both – never
   neither (which would isolate it as two 6-cycles): every edge has a *straight*
   side (`DescriptiveComplexity.side_straight`).
4. **Chain propagation.** A straight side `(b,a)` frees the entrance and exit
   slots of the opposite side `(a,b)` from the cross edges
   (`DescriptiveComplexity.g0_other`/`g5_other`); the freed slot is a selector at the
   ends of `a`'s chain, or a chain-link that straightens the walked side in turn
   (`DescriptiveComplexity.straight_of_chain_down`/`up`). Well-founded induction along
   `a`'s neighbor list puts a selector at both chain ends: `a` is *active*
   (`DescriptiveComplexity.active_of_straight`).
5. **The cover.** `C := {a | Active f a}` covers every edge
   (`DescriptiveComplexity.cover_property`), and `|C| ≤ |marked|` by the
   selector-slot injection (`DescriptiveComplexity.active_ncard_le`).

`DescriptiveComplexity.eq_gPt_of_val` below reconstructs a vertex from its tag and
coordinates (sidestepping a `simp`/subtype mismatch), the workhorse of step 1.
