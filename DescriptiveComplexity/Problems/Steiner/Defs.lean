# Steiner Tree: definitions

STEINER TREE ([Karp 1972][karp1972reducibility]) in its *node-weighted* form
with unit weights: given a graph, a set of *terminals* and a threshold `k`, is
there a connected set of vertices containing every terminal and using at most
`k` non-terminals? The vocabulary `FirstOrder.Language.steinerGraph` is that of
graphs with two unary marks – the terminals, and the marked set carrying `k`
in the *unary representation* of `DescriptiveComplexity.Numbers.Unary`.

Karp's original problem weights *edges* and bounds the total weight; on a tree
the two readings differ by one (`#edges = #vertices - 1`), so the reduction
below would carry over, but the bridge between them needs the fact that a
connected graph has at least `n - 1` edges. Mathlib has it only for trees on a
whole vertex type (`SimpleGraph.IsTree.card_edgeFinset`), so the edge-weighted
version waits for that glue; the node-weighted version is the standard variant
and is what this file formalizes.

## Connectivity, and its first-order certificate

Connectivity (`DescriptiveComplexity.ConnectedOn`) is stated with
`Relation.ReflTransGen` over the *symmetric* restriction of adjacency to the
chosen set, so it is the usual undirected notion and is not first-order. As
for acyclicity in `DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.Feedback`, what saves the
membership proof is a certificate: a root of the chosen set together with a
strict partial order in which every other chosen vertex has a chosen neighbor
strictly below it (`DescriptiveComplexity.connectedOn_iff_exists_root_order`). Walking
down that order reaches the root, and the root joins any two vertices.

Producing the certificate from connectivity is the direction with content: it
needs a *distance*, which `Relation.ReflTransGen` does not carry. The
`DescriptiveComplexity.reachIn` staging below supplies it – reachability in at most
`n` steps, with `Nat.find` picking the least such `n` – and that is the whole
of the extra machinery. It is stated for an arbitrary relation, so the
Hamilton problems and the edge-weighted Steiner tree can reuse it.

/-! #### Connectivity costs edges

The certificate gives each non-root member of a connected set a *parent edge*,
and that assignment is injective: two members sharing an edge would have to be
each other's parent, hence strictly below each other. This is the
`n - 1` edge bound for connected graphs, in the form the edge-weighted Steiner
tree needs, and it is proved from the certificate rather than from a spanning
tree. -/
