# The `k`-round game: what a `Σₖ` definition of alternating acceptance guesses

`DescriptiveComplexity.ATMData.AltAcc` recurses one step at a time; a `Σₖ`
sentence has `k` quantifiers and must therefore commit a whole *round* at a
time. This file defines the round game – the object the second-order blocks of
the membership proof guess – together with the facts about walks it needs. No
vocabulary appears, as in `DescriptiveComplexity.Machines`; the file sits under
`Problems/Machine` only because it reads the rank machinery of
`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.Machine.Walk`.

## What a round guesses

A *walk* is a configuration per position, positions being times as everywhere
in the bridge. Round `i`'s walk is asked for three things
(`DescriptiveComplexity.ATMData.LegalBelow`):

* it is initial at the lowest position;
* its blocks never decrease along the order
  (`DescriptiveComplexity.ATMData.BlkMono`) – true of any real run, and needed
  of a *guess* so that the times of a block form one stretch rather than
  several;
* at each immediate successor it steps *out of a non-accepting configuration*,
  or stutters in an accepting or stuck one – **but only where its state is in a
  block below `i`**.

Acceptance is therefore absorbing: a walk that has accepted may not move again,
so it still accepts at the highest position, and every later round is obliged
to copy it. Without that, a round could step past an acceptance and let a later
player steer the run into rejection, while
`DescriptiveComplexity.ATMData.AltAcc` grants an accepting configuration
outright.

The last restriction is what keeps the game cheap. Round `i` answers for the
blocks up to `i` and no further, so its walk may be arbitrary from the moment
it hands over; that is why building a witness never needs a legal continuation
to the end of time. Stuttering must be allowed at a *stuck* configuration, not
only at an accepting one as in `DescriptiveComplexity.TMData.IsWalk`: otherwise
a machine that stops has no legal walk at all, the universal rounds become
vacuous, and getting stuck would count as accepting – the opposite of the
convention of `DescriptiveComplexity.MachinesAlt`.

## What a round inherits

`DescriptiveComplexity.ATMData.AgreeBelow` makes round `i` reproduce what the
earlier rounds committed: the configuration at every time whose block – *in the
previous round's walk* – is below `i`, and the configuration at the immediate
successor of such a time. The second clause is not redundant: the move out of
the last configuration of block `i - 1` belongs to the previous player, so the
successor of a committed time is committed too. At `i = 0` both clauses are
vacuous, which is why the first round is free
(`DescriptiveComplexity.ATMData.altGame_eq_gameFrom`).

## The order lemmas

Two facts about the linear order of the positions are proved here and used
throughout: induction upwards from a position
(`DescriptiveComplexity.ATMData.le_induction`), and the successor function
`DescriptiveComplexity.ATMData.nextPos` walking along it, whose rank increases
by one until the highest position is reached.
