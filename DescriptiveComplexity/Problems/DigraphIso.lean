# Digraph Isomorphism, and the degree it defines

DIGRAPH ISOMORPHISM: are the two *directed* graphs of the instance isomorphic?
The vocabulary is the pattern-and-host one of
`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.SubgraphIso`
(`FirstOrder.Language.twoGraphs`, two marks and two binary relations – nothing
asks them to be symmetric, which is what makes this the directed problem), and
the yes-instances are the structures whose two marked subgraphs are isomorphic
(`DescriptiveComplexity.RelIsoOn`); as everywhere in the catalog, elements
outside both marks are junk that no condition mentions.

The undirected problem, which is what the literature calls graph isomorphism,
is `DescriptiveComplexity.GraphIso` (`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.GraphIso`);
it reduces to this one by testing simplicity first-order. The converse
reduction – the classical digraph-to-graph gadget – is what the degree below is
still anchored on this problem for.

Two things make this problem worth its own file.

**It is the library's first problem conjecturally neither in P nor
NP-complete.** Membership is a textbook `Σ₁` – guess a binary relation, check
first-order that it is a bijection of the pattern vertices onto the host
vertices preserving adjacency in both directions – with no order, no counting
and no threshold, so `DescriptiveComplexity.digraphIso_mem_NP` is cheap. No
hardness result accompanies it, and none is expected: the problem is in NP,
is not known to be in P, and is not known to be NP-complete ([Babai
2016][babai2016graph] gives a quasipolynomial algorithm; [Köbler, Schöning and
Torán 1993][kobler1993graph] is the structural account).

**It is one half of the reason `DescriptiveComplexity.ComplexityClass.below`
exists.** “GI-complete” is the standard example of completeness for the degree
of a *problem* rather than for a logically defined class. The degree itself
(`DescriptiveComplexity.GI`) is defined on the *undirected* problem, in
`DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.GraphIso.Defs`, since that is what the
literature names GI; this problem is complete for it too
(`DescriptiveComplexity.digraphIso_GI_complete`), the two being
interreducible.

There is also a pleasant circularity worth noting: a decision problem in this
library is by definition an isomorphism-invariant property of finite structures
(`DescriptiveComplexity.DecisionProblem`), so isomorphism is the problem of
deciding the very equivalence the framework quotients by. That reading is
`DescriptiveComplexity.relIsoOn_iff_equiv`: the semantic condition is
literally the existence of an equivalence between the two marked sets carrying
one adjacency relation to the other.
