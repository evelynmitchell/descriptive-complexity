# Surjectivity from a flip

A sentence can say that a guessed family of sets contains the empty set and is
closed under flipping a single element, and it can say that the guess is
injective. It cannot say that the guess is **onto**: quantifying over all sets
is second order, and a first-order kernel over an extended universe has no way
to reach them.

This file is what buys surjectivity anyway, and it is a counting argument in
Lean rather than a condition in the logic. A family containing the empty set and
closed under one-element flips is *everything*
(`DescriptiveComplexity.eq_of_flipClosed`), because every finite set is reached
from the empty one by flipping its elements in one at a time; so an injective
guess into it is a bijection (`DescriptiveComplexity.bijective_of_flipClosed`,
and its set-valued reading `DescriptiveComplexity.bijective_of_flipClosedP`).

That is the shape the exponential rung of value invention needs: *invent
exponentially many* is not a condition a sentence states, it is a bound the
definition carries, and this is where the bound is spent.
