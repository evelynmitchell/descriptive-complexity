# Alternating machines in bounded space

The fourth acceptance notion of `DescriptiveComplexity.TMData`, and the one
that reaches EXPTIME: an *alternating* machine whose tape is indexed by the
positions, with **no bound on the length of a play and no bound on the number
of alternations**. It stands to `DescriptiveComplexity.ATMData.AltAccepts`
exactly as `DescriptiveComplexity.TMData.AcceptsSpace` stands to
`DescriptiveComplexity.TMData.Accepts`: the step budget is dropped, the space
stays bounded by construction, and what changes is that a play no longer fits
inside the structure.

## Winning, as an inductive predicate

`DescriptiveComplexity.ATMData.AltAcc` recurses on a budget, which is what makes
it a Lean-level recursion rather than a fixed point. With the budget gone the
right presentation is the **least fixed point** of the game operator, and in
Lean that is an inductive predicate
(`DescriptiveComplexity.ATMData.AltWin`): an accepting state wins; an
existential configuration wins when *some* successor does; a universal one when
it has a successor and *every* successor wins. Looping therefore loses, which is
the standard convention and the one that agrees with the budgeted definition
(`DescriptiveComplexity.ATMData.altWin_iff_exists_altAcc`).

Being an inductive rather than a `∃ n` also makes the correspondence with the
AND/OR game of alternating reachability a matter of matching constructors, which
is what the EXPTIME membership proof consumes.

## Unbounded alternation, at no cost

`DescriptiveComplexity.ATMData.BlocksWellFormed` is what bounds the number of
alternations, by forbidding a transition from lowering the block index; it is
*not* imposed here. What is imposed instead is only that the marks partition the
states in two (`DescriptiveComplexity.ATMData.BlocksSplit`), so that block `0`
is the existential player and block `1` the universal one
(`DescriptiveComplexity.ATMData.isUniv_true_iff_blk_one`). No second machine
record is needed and no lemma of `DescriptiveComplexity.MachinesAlt` has to be
restated: the vocabulary is `FirstOrder.Language.turingAlt 2` unchanged.

/-! ### Winning the game on the configuration graph -/

/-- **Winning the alternating game**, with no bound on the length of a play: an
accepting state wins; an existential configuration wins when some successor
does; a universal one wins when it has a successor and every successor wins.

Being a least fixed point, this makes an infinite play a loss for the
existential player – the standard convention, and the one the budgeted
`DescriptiveComplexity.ATMData.AltAcc` already has. -/

  successor wins. -/
  | all {c : Config A} : M.IsUniv start c.state → (∃ c', M.Step c c') →
      (∀ c', M.Step c c' → AltWin start c') → AltWin start c

/-- **Acceptance in bounded space**: an initial configuration wins, the choice
of that configuration belonging to the player who moves first – exactly as in
`DescriptiveComplexity.ATMData.AltAccepts`, and for the same reason. -/

/-- **Without a universal state, winning is reaching an accepting state.** The
alternating model is a conservative extension of the space-bounded
nondeterministic one, exactly as
`DescriptiveComplexity.ATMData.altAcc_iff_stepsIn` says of the budgeted
model. -/

unbounded alternation needs: no state carries a mark above `1`, and every state
carries exactly one of the two. `DescriptiveComplexity.ATMData.BlocksWellFormed`
is deliberately *not* required – its ordering clause is what bounds the number
of alternations. -/

/-- **Block `1` is the universal player.** With the marks split in two, the
polarity bookkeeping of `DescriptiveComplexity.blockPol` collapses to a single
mark, so the model reads as an ordinary alternating machine with an
existential and a universal set of states. -/
