# The bit of a rank, as a head program

The fragment `DescriptiveComplexity.HeadProgram.bitP`: a deterministic
multi-head program deciding **`BIT`**, that is, whether the bit of the rank of
one head at the index given by the rank of another is set. It is what lets the
multi-head automaton of `DescriptiveComplexity.HeadEvalArith` evaluate the
bit-level logic of `DescriptiveComplexity.LogTime` – the third arithmetic
fragment, beside `DescriptiveComplexity.HeadProgram.plusP` and
`DescriptiveComplexity.HeadProgram.timesP`.

## The algorithm: halve, then read the parity

`BIT(x, i)` is `(x / 2 ^ i) % 2 = 1`, so the program **halves the value `i`
times and then asks for its parity**. Both loops are the shape this development
already uses: an outer loop counting the rounds, and inside it a *scan* that
walks a candidate up the order asking, at each stop, whether the candidate is
the half of the current value. That question is two additions, so the scan's
probe is an addition fragment – a decider made to compute, exactly as
`timesP`'s scan reuses `plusP`.

The half of `v` is the `c` with `c + c = v` (`v` even) or `c + (c + 1) = v`
(`v` odd), and the two are tested in that order at each candidate, so the scan
stops at the first `c` that works and that `c` is `v / 2` whatever the parity.
The successor `c + 1` is not an addition but a head: the program moves `w` to
the successor of the candidate, which is why the overflow test comes *before*
that move – a successor move at the greatest element is disabled, and the walk
would be stuck rather than wrong.

## The parity, and why it needs no guard

After the last round the value is `x / 2 ^ i`, and its parity is read by a
second scan: `v` is **even** exactly when some `c` has `c + c = v`, and such a
`c` is `v / 2 ≤ v`, so the scan finds it if it exists. The scan therefore
answers `false` at the first candidate that halves `v`, and `true` when it
reaches the marker having found none. No test against zero is needed anywhere,
which is what makes the two scans the same four nodes with different exits.

## What the fragment costs

Five working heads – the value, the round counter, the scan's candidate, the
successor `w`, and the scan's marker – above the interface, and the addition's
own three scratch heads above those; the marker is parked by the fragment
itself, as `plusP`'s is, so a caller has no discipline to keep beyond the head
layout `DescriptiveComplexity.HeadProgram.BitHeads`. The clock is
`O(log n)` rounds of a scan, hence `O(n log n)` steps – irrelevant to the space
bound, which is the number of heads.
