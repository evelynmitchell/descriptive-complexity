# FO(DTC): first-order logic with deterministic transitive closure

The logic that captures *deterministic* logarithmic space on ordered
structures ([Immerman 1987][immerman1987languages]): first-order logic with a
transitive-closure operator that may only follow a step when it is the *only*
step available. `DescriptiveComplexity.LOGSPACE` is defined by it, exactly as
`DescriptiveComplexity.NL` is defined by the Krom fragment and
`DescriptiveComplexity.PTIME` by the Horn one.

## Determinism as a formula, not as a side condition

There are two ways to say “the walk is deterministic”. One is to carry a
proof: a specification together with the hypothesis that its `Step` relation is
functional on every structure. That is the wrong choice here – the hypothesis is
not first-order data, and it would have to be re-established after every
pullback, at which point closure under reductions stops being a syntactic
argument.

The other is Immerman's own: keep an arbitrary
`DescriptiveComplexity.TCSpec` and read its transition formula through its
*determinization*

```
detStep(x̄, ȳ)  :=  step(x̄, ȳ)  ∧  ∀ z̄. step(x̄, z̄) → z̄ = ȳ
```

which is again first-order. Every specification then denotes a legitimate
deterministic walk (`DescriptiveComplexity.TCSpec.det_functional`), nothing has to be
preserved, and nothing is lost: on a specification whose steps are already
functional the determinization is equivalent to it
(`DescriptiveComplexity.TCSpec.det_step_of_functional`).

The one wrinkle the textbook formula does not show is **modes**. A node of a
`DescriptiveComplexity.TCSpec` is a mode together with a tuple
(`DescriptiveComplexity.TCSpec.Node`), so “the only step available” has to quantify
over successor *nodes*, not successor tuples: the uniqueness clause is a finite
conjunction over the modes, in which the mode comparison is resolved at
formula-construction time (`⊥` for a mode other than the intended target, so
that a step into it refutes the guard). This is the same static/dynamic split
as the tag comparisons of `DescriptiveComplexity.lexLeF`.

## What is here

`DescriptiveComplexity.TCSpec.det` and its semantics
(`DescriptiveComplexity.TCSpec.det_step_iff`: a determinized step is a step with no
competitor), the resulting definability notion
`DescriptiveComplexity.DTCDefinable`, and the inclusion at the level of definability,
`DescriptiveComplexity.DTCDefinable.tcDefinable` – the future `L ⊆ NL`, a one-liner
because a determinized specification *is* a specification.

no other step out of the current node. The competing successors are quantified
as a tuple `z̄` and a *mode* `m'`; the mode is compared statically, so the
uniqueness clause has one conjunct per mode, asserting `z̄ = ȳ` at the intended
one and refuting the step at every other. -/

numerals at `Fin spec.det.k` elaborate as they do at `Fin spec.k`. -/

/-! ### FO(DTC) definability -/

/-- A decision problem is *FO(DTC) definable* if, on nonempty finite *ordered*
structures, it is defined by a single **deterministic** transitive closure:
there is a `DescriptiveComplexity.TCSpec` whose accepting nodes are reachable from
its starting nodes *along its determinization* exactly on the yes-instances.

As for `DescriptiveComplexity.TCDefinable`, the equivalence is required for every
linear order on the universe, so this is order-invariant FO(DTC) definability:
the problem itself does not see the order, while the transition and endpoint
formulas may. The order cannot be guessed away here either
(`DescriptiveComplexity.sotcDefinable_iff_free` is what SO(TC) can do and this
logic cannot): a deterministic walk has nothing to guess with. -/
