# Turing machines over a universe, without a vocabulary

The semantics half of the machine bridge: what it means for a nondeterministic
Turing machine, presented as *relations on a universe*, to accept. No
vocabulary appears here – `DescriptiveComplexity.Problems.Machine.Defs` supplies one and
reads these definitions off a structure – so that the reductions, which build
machines rather than read them, can reason about runs without unfolding any
`RelMap`.

## The model

A machine is `DescriptiveComplexity.TMData`: the sorts (`Posn`, `Tr`), the marks
(`Start`, `Acc`, `Blank`, `Right`), the binary attributes of a transition
(`Src`, `Read`, `Dst`, `Write`), the initial tape `Inp`, and a linear order
`Le`. Two decisions are visible in the types.

* **Transitions are elements.** A transition is an element `τ` of the universe
  with four binary attributes, rather than a 5-ary relation; every relation
  here has arity at most two, which is what keeps the defining formulas of an
  interpretation indexed by *pairs* of tags.
* **Time steps and tape cells are the same sort.** A configuration's head is a
  position, and the time bound of `DescriptiveComplexity.TMData.Accepts` is the *number*
  of positions – a unary bound by construction, with no arithmetic. A head at
  the last position moving right has no successor
  (`DescriptiveComplexity.SuccPos` fails), and the run simply stops.

A run is read in three ways, and which one a construction uses is what its
resource bound can see. `DescriptiveComplexity.TMData.StepsIn` counts exactly, so
two phases of unknown length do not compose; `Relation.ReflTransGen` composes but
carries no count, so `DescriptiveComplexity.TMData.Accepts` cannot read it; and
`DescriptiveComplexity.TMData.ReachesIn` – a run of *at most* `n` steps – does
both, composing by adding budgets and weakening upwards. A clocked program is
written with the third and a space-bounded one with its erasure, which is how the
two share their phase lemmas.

The tape is a total function `A → A`, so the semantics is total: reading a cell
never fails. Which functions count as *initial* tapes is
`DescriptiveComplexity.TMData.InitTape` – the input where it is defined, blank elsewhere –
stated as a relation so that no choice is needed and so that the first-order
kernel of the membership proof can check it literally.

## Transport

`DescriptiveComplexity.TMData.Agree` records that two machines over different universes
correspond along an equivalence, fieldwise; `DescriptiveComplexity.TMData.Agree.accepts`
transports acceptance along it. This is all the isomorphism-invariance proof of
the decision problems needs.

/-- **One step.** Some transition applies in the current state to the symbol
under the head: it writes in that cell, changes state, and moves the head to
the neighboring position in the direction it names. Cells other than the one
under the head are unchanged, and a move off the end of the tape is impossible
– there being no such neighbor, no step is available and the run stops. -/

/-- **Acceptance**: some run from an initial configuration reaches an accepting
state within as many steps as there are positions.

The bound is unary by construction – it counts elements of the universe – which
is what makes this an NP problem rather than an NEXP one, with no arithmetic
anywhere. A reduction buys itself `|Tag| · nᵈ` steps by choosing the dimension
`d` of its interpretation.

The bound is *strict* because the positions index the time points of the run:
`N` of them leave `N - 1` steps between them, which is what makes
`DescriptiveComplexity.TMData.accepts_iff_exists_walk` an equivalence and not
merely an implication. -/

  ∃ (c₀ c : Config A) (n : ℕ), M.IsInit c₀ ∧ n < Nat.card {p : A // M.Posn p} ∧
    M.StepsIn n c₀ c ∧ M.Acc c.state

/-- **Acceptance in bounded space**: some run from an initial configuration
reaches an accepting state, with *no bound on its length*.

This is `DescriptiveComplexity.TMData.Accepts` with the step bound dropped, and
that is all the difference between the time-bounded and the space-bounded model:
the space is already bounded by construction, since the tape is indexed by the
positions and a reduction of dimension `d` therefore buys `nᵈ` cells exactly as
it buys `nᵈ` steps. What changes is that a run no longer fits inside the
structure – it may visit exponentially many configurations – so acceptance is
*reachability* in the configuration graph rather than a walk indexed by the
positions, which is why the membership proof for the space-bounded problems is
an SO(TC) specification rather than a `Σ₁` definition. -/
def AcceptsSpace : Prop :=
  ∃ c₀ c : Config A, M.IsInit c₀ ∧ Relation.ReflTransGen M.Step c₀ c ∧ M.Acc c.state

/-- **Reaching one configuration from another within a budget**: some run of at
most `n` steps.

This is the form in which a program's phases are stated when the machine is on a
clock. `DescriptiveComplexity.TMData.StepsIn` counts exactly, so two phases whose
lengths are not known separately do not compose; `Relation.ReflTransGen` composes
but carries no count, and `DescriptiveComplexity.TMData.Accepts` cannot read it.
A budget is what does both: it composes by adding
(`DescriptiveComplexity.TMData.ReachesIn.trans`), it weakens upwards
(`DescriptiveComplexity.TMData.ReachesIn.mono`), so a phase may be charged more
than it spends and the arithmetic done once at the end, and it still gives the
witness `Accepts` asks for. The space-bounded reading is its erasure
(`DescriptiveComplexity.TMData.ReachesIn.reflTransGen`). -/
